# 1. What Is Research?

Research begins with curiosity — a question about how the world works.\
In this course we work with existing datasets, but behind each dataset there is (or should be) a **research question**.

This week connects your earlier work on **data types and levels of measurement** (Lecture 01) with:

-   research questions and hypotheses\
-   independent and dependent variables\
-   study design\
-   how variables are represented in data sets

By the end of this week you should be able to:

-   turn an informal idea into a **research question** and a **testable hypothesis**\
-   identify **independent** and **dependent** variables\
-   classify variables by **type** and **level of measurement**\
-   understand how design and variables shape statistical analysis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. The Research Cycle

We can think of research as a simple cycle:

::: callout-note
### A simplified research cycle

1.  **Observation**\
    Something you notice about the world.\
    *Example:* Some students study a lot but do not always achieve high marks.

2.  **Research question**\
    A focused, answerable question.\
    *Example:* Is there an association between hours of study and overall mark?

3.  **Hypothesis**\
    A testable prediction.\
    *Example:* Students who study more hours per week will achieve higher marks.

4.  **Identify variables**\
    Decide what you will measure.

    -   **IV:** *Study_hours*\
    -   **DV:** *Overall_mark*

5.  **Collect data**\
    Gather values for these variables in a sample.

6.  **Analyse data**\
    Summarise variables and test relationships.

7.  **Interpret and conclude**\
    Relate the results back to the research question.
:::

This week focuses on **Step 4** because everything else depends on identifying variables correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2.1 From Constructs to Variables (link to Lecture 01)

In Lecture 01 we noted that before data collection, researchers must decide **what they intend to measure**. They begin with abstract ideas (*constructs*), such as *stress*, *learning*, or *academic success*. Constructs cannot be observed directly — we only see them through the **measures** we choose.

![](images/concept_measurement.png){width="70%"}

The logic is:

-   **Constructs** are theoretical ideas.\
-   **Measures** operationalise these ideas.\
-   **Variables** are the recorded data.\
-   All variables contain some **measurement error**.

In this course we mainly work at the level of **variables**, but it is important to remember where they come from.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Variables in Research

A **variable** is any characteristic that varies between individuals.

In *Lecture1_data.csv*, variables include:

-   `Gender`, `Degree`, `Exercise`\
-   `Study_hours`, `Sleep_hours`\
-   `Stress_level`, `Satisfaction_Likert_item`\
-   `Overall_mark`, `IQ`

Variables can be classified in two ways:

1.  **By role** — how they function in the research design\
2.  **By type** — the kind of information they contain

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.1 Variables by Role: Independent and Dependent

::: {.narrow-table style="font-size: 0.95rem"}
| **Role** | **What it does** | **Example from the dataset** |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Independent variable (IV)** | Used to explain/predict something; sometimes manipulated | `Study_hours`, `Gender`, `Exercise` |
| **Dependent variable (DV)** | The outcome being measured | `Overall_mark`, `Sleep_hours`, `Stress_level` |
:::

A simple way to remember:

> **IV → DV**\
> “Does X influence / predict / relate to Y?”

Examples using the lecture dataset:

-   *Does **study time** predict **overall marks**?*
    -   IV: `Study_hours`\
    -   DV: `Overall_mark`
-   *Do **students who exercisesleep more**?*
    -   IV: `Exercise`\
    -   DV: `Sleep_hours`
-   *Is **stress level** related to **hours of study**?*
    -   IV: `Study_hours`\
    -   DV: `Stress_level`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3.2 Manipulated vs Measured Variables

-   **Manipulated variables**
    -   Assigned by the researcher (e.g. an experiment).

    -   Not present in this dataset.
-   **Measured variables**
    -   Naturally occurring characteristics recorded by the researcher.
    -   All variables in *Lecture1_data.csv* are **measured**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. Variables in the Lecture Dataset

```{r}
#| message: false

```

Below is a description of all variables in the Lecture1_data.csv dataset.

```{r lecture-dataset, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(gt)
library(dplyr)

lecture1_dict <- tribble(
~Variable,                      ~Description,
"ID",                           "Participant ID (unique identifier)",

## 4.1 Variables by Type: Categorical and Numeric

We also classify variables by the *kind* of information they contain. This affects:

-   how we **summarise** them (counts, means, medians, etc.)\
-   which **plots** we use (bar plots, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)\
-   which **statistical tests** are appropriate

### **4.1.1 Categorical variables**

> They group observations into labels.
>
> Example variables in the lecture dataset:

-   `Gender`

-   `Exercise`

-   `Degree`

-   `Stress_level`

-   `Satisfaction_Likert_item`

-   `Satisfaction_Likert_value` (ordinal coded)

#### Subtypes

-   **Nominal:** no natural order (e.g. Gender, Degree)

-   **Ordinal:** meaningful order (e.g. Stress_level, Satisfaction ratings)

We **summarise** categorical variables using:

-   frequencies (counts)

-   percentages / proportions

-   bar plots

### 4.1.2 Numeric variables

Examples in the lecture dataset:

-   `Study_hours`

-   `Sleep_hours`

-   `Overall_mark`

-   `IQ`

-   `Coffee_per_day`

-   `Social_media_hr`

#### Subtypes:

-   **Discrete** (counts): `Coffee_per_day`

-   **Continuous** (measurements): `Study_hours`, `IQ`, `Sleep_hours`

We **summarise** numeric variables using:

-   means, medians

-   standard deviation, IQR

-   histograms, boxplots, scatterplots

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 5. Levels of Measurement

In Lecture 01 you met four classic levels of measurement. Here we briefly reconnect them to research design, using variables from the *Lecture1_data.csv* dataset.

::: {.narrow-table style="font-size: 0.9rem"}
| **Level** | **Meaning** | **Examples (lecture dataset)** |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Nominal** | Categories with no intrinsic order | `Gender`, `Degree`, `Exercise` |
| **Ordinal** | Ordered categories, unequal gaps | `Stress_level`, `Satisfaction_Likert_value` |
| **Interval** | Numeric, equal spacing, **no** true zero | IQ (treated as an approximate interval scale in psychology) |
| **Ratio** | Numeric, equal spacing, **true** zero | `Study_hours`, `Sleep_hours`, `Overall_mark`, `Coffee_per_day`, `Social_media_hr` |
:::

In practice we often talk simply about **categorical** vs **numeric** variables, but levels of measurement sit in the background and influence what is sensible:

-   you would not normally compute a **mean** of nominal data\
-   you should be cautious interpreting means of ordinal scales\
-   most parametric tests (e.g. t-tests, correlation) assume **numeric (interval/ratio)** data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Exercise: Classifying Variables in the Lecture Dataset

Use the variables from *Lecture1_data.csv* to practise identifying:

1. whether each variable is **categorical** or **numeric**  
2. the **level of measurement**  
3. whether it could be an **IV**, a **DV**, or either  

Consider the following variables:

- `Gender`  
- `Exercise`  
- `Study_hours`  
- `Overall_mark`  
- `Stress_level`  
- `Coffee_per_day`  
- `Social_media_hr`

### Your Task

Complete the table below by filling in the **Type**, **Level**, and **Possible Role(s)** for each variable.

::: {.narrow-table style="font-size: 0.9rem"}
| **Variable**        | **Type** (Categorical/Numeric) | **Level** | **Possible Role(s)** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Gender              |                                |           |                        |
| Exercise            |                                |           |                        |
| Stress_level        |                                |           |                        |
| Study_hours         |                                |           |                        |
| Overall_mark        |                                |           |                        |
| Coffee_per_day      |                                |           |                        |
| Social_media_hr     |                                |           |                        |

### Example research questions

- *Does study time predict overall marks?*  
- *Do students who exercise sleep more?*  
- *Are stress levels associated with time spent on social media?*  
- *Do male and female students differ in their study hours?*
