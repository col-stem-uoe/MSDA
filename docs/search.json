For example in the Chinese Zhuangzi (~300 BCE),\n\nIf from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.\n\n\nLets say that the length of the stick on day \\(d\\) is denoted \\(L_d\\).\n\nFind an expression for \\(L_d\\) in terms of \\(L_{d-1}\\) (i.e. the day before).\n\n\nFind an expression for \\(L_d\\) that only depends on \\(d\\).\n\nCharlie argues that our formulation can‚Äôt be correct because the paradox says to ‚Äòtake‚Äô half the stick away, so any correct formula must involve a subtraction. They present the following answer: \\[\n  L_d = 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^d \\frac{1}{2^n}.\n\\]\n\nIs Charlie‚Äôs argument correct? How does their answer compare to yours?"

    "text": "Probability is perhaps the area of maths closest to statistics, and looking at problems in one often motivates solutions in the other. That‚Äôs all a bit abstract though‚Ä¶\n\n\nProbability is the study of chance. Given some event, its probability is a number between zero and one to how likely an event is to happen.\n\nIf the probability is zero, the event is impossible;\nIf the probability is one, the event is certain to happen.\n\nThe higher the probability, the more likely the event is to happen. If the probability is a half for example, the event is just as likely to happen as it is to not happen.\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúprobability of event \\(A\\)‚Äù is usually expressed as \\(\\mathbb{P}(A)\\). The probability of landing on heads if you toss a coin could therefore be expressed as \\(\\mathbb{P}(H)\\), where \\(H\\) stands for ‚Äúthe coin landed on heads‚Äù.\nIf the event could have multiple outcomes, say the roll of a dice, then the notation is slightly different. If \\(D\\) rolling a six-sided dice, we say \\(\\mathbb{P}(D = 5)\\) for the probability that the dice lands on a five.\n\n\n\nProbabilities lie between zero and one, but they can be expressed as:\n\nfractions, for instance \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\ndecimals, for instance \\(0.5\\),\npercentages, for instance \\(50\\%\\),\nchances, for instance 1 in 2 chance,\nratios1, for instance 1:1.\n\nThese equivalent expressions are often used interchangeably and can be used for any probability we wish to represent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nFor example, there‚Äôs a one in six chance of rolling a five on a fair die. This is usually represented as \\(\\mathbb{P}(D = 5) = \\frac{1}{6}\\), but we could represent this as \\(0.167\\), \\(16.7\\%\\), or \\(1:5\\) odds.\n\n\nIn this course, we usually express probabilities either as an exact value, usually in fraction form, or as a decimal number, rounded either using significant figures or decimal places.\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the theoretical probability of an event, we need to know the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) of an experiment.\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for when we roll a die (the singular of dice) is the set of the six possible outcomes \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\). In this case, all these outcomes are equally likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen each outcome of an experiment is equally likely, the probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes contained within the event by the total number of outcomes of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the probablity of rolling a 4?\n\nThere are 4 outcomes in the sample space \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\). The event we wish to find is rolling a four, which is just one of six possible outcomes. So the probability of rolling a six is 1 divided by 6, or \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the probability of rolling a number larger than 3?\n\nTo find the probability of rolling a number larger than 3 consider the number of outcomes that ‚Äúsatisfy‚Äù this requirement. The three outcomes are: rolling a \\(4\\), rolling a \\(5\\) or rolling a \\(6\\). There are still \\(6\\) possible outcomes in total and the probability of each is \\(\\frac16\\), so the probability of rolling a number larger than \\(3\\) is given by \\(\\frac36\\), which equals $ $.\n\n\n\n\nSome probabilities like the ones we just looked at can be understood logically, using theory. In other cases, we cannot figure out the probability of an event using logic alone.\nFor example, if we wanted to know the probability that a woman from a particular population will be between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, we need to collect data, i.e. measure the heights of a large number of women in that population to see how many are between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, and use this to estimate the probability for the whole population.\nWe call such a probability an experimental probability.\n\n\n\nConsider the graph below. On the horizontal axis, we have the number of times a fair six-sided dice was rolled. On the vertical axis we have value from 1 to 6. The graph represents the average of the results. As the number of times that you roll the die increases, the closer the average comes to the mean average between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\): \\(3.5\\).\n\n\n\n{wallet}\n\n\nThis is called the Law of large numbers. In concrete terms, says that the proportion of the outcomes will approximate their theoretical probabilities as the number of trials increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nIf we throw a dice ten times, it is unlikely2 that all six possible outcomes will be equally represented in the outcome. But if you increase the number of times that you roll the dice, each outcome will be more and more equally represented. Set the number of dice to one and then use this Geogebra page to see how the outcomes even out as you throw the dice more often.\n\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll return to this example in this weeks workshops, looking at how the number of dice impacts the outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some more advanced concepts in probability that we need to cover, but before we can get to those we should probably take a quick detour to properly cover set notation. If this is a concept you‚Äôve seen before, feel free to skip forwards!\n\n\nSets are mathematical objects that are, simply put, collections of elements. The are written with curly brackets. They are similar to lists, but lists are ordered and allow for repetition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSet of objects on the table: {keys, coffee cup, pen, ‚Ä¶}\nSet of people in a room: {Joumana, Julie, Alistair, Yotam}\nSet of numbers strictly between one and nine: {x | 1 &lt; x &lt; 9}\n\n\n\nThe concept of a sample space in probability has an equivalent for sets more generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nThe universal set is the set of all objects and depends on the context. The universal set of all socks in the world, or the universal set of all students in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nSets on their own are mathematically interesting, and they can quite quickly lead to complicated ideas.[^You might have heard of Russell‚Äôs paradox, the set of sets that contain themselves. However of more interest is how they interact with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefiniion\n\n\n\n\nThe union (denoted \\(\\cup\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in either set.\nThe intersection (denoted \\(\\cap\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in both sets.\nThe difference (denoted \\(\\backslash\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in one set by not the other.\n\n\n\nThis is a way of abstractly defining familiar ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nSay \\(A\\) is the set of odd numbers between 10 and 20: {11,13,15,17,19}.3. Define \\(B\\) as the prime numbers between 0 and 15: {2,3,5,7,11,13}. The union of these two sets is \\(A\\cup B\\) = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}. The intersection of the two sets is: \\(A\\cap B\\) = {11,13}.\n\n\nThese ideas aren‚Äôt just limited to numbers thought!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nConsider the set of objects on the table, {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator}, and the set of belongings I need to take with me: {keys, pen, wallet}.\nThe union of the two sets is {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator, wallet}, while the intersection is {keys, pen}. The difference between the objects on the table and those I need to take with me is {wallet} - I wonder where I left it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place sets come up most frequently is in Venn diagrams.\n\n\n\nxkcd.com/773/\n\n\nA Venn diagram is a diagram style that shows the relation between sets, and was invented by English mathematician and logician John Venn in the 1880s. As the diagrams can be used to represent sets we can use them to represent probabilities for combinations of different events. The circles each represent one set. There can be any number of sets[^Though if we want circles, that limits us to three! Beyond that we have to introduce ellipses, sausages, and other squiggly constructs.]. The rectangle around them is the universal set, denoted \\(\\mathfrak{U}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA survey was done on first year students on what they felt made them like some animals more than others. \\(42\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that was fluffy, while \\(28\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that had big teeth. \\(4\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal with both of these characteristics.\nWe can use these data to estimate the probability that a student will favour an animal that is fluffy OR has big teeth, or is fluffy AND has big teeth. Below we see a Venn diagram of the probabilities that a student‚Äôs favourite animal will be fluffy, have big teeth, or be fluffy and have big teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this diagram you can see for instance that although \\(28\\%\\) of students seem to prefer animals with big teeth, \\(24\\%\\) students preferred them to have big teeth but NOT be fluffy.\n\n\nWith this squared away, we can return to probability proper and better understand some of its more complicated concepts.\n\n\n\n\nProbability is governed by laws which allow us to understand more complicated questions of chance. If we have more than one event, we need to start thinking about how to combine the events and their probabilities.\n\n\nIn most probability frameworks, whether an event happens is binary: it either happens or it doesn‚Äôt happen. From this, we get a probability relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliment Rule\n\n\n\nFor an event \\(A\\), since \\(\\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1\\), \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(A),\n\\] where \\(\\text{not}~A\\) is sometimes shortened to \\(A'\\), \\(\\overline{A}\\), or \\(A^{\\text{c}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: $ ={1,2,3,4,5,6} $. Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\).\nThe event \\(A'\\) is the event that we roll a number that is not greater than \\(2\\) (i.e. rolling a \\(1\\) or a \\(2\\)), so: \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A') = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not greater than}~2) = \\frac{2}{6}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have two events called \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The probabilities for ‚Äú\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)‚Äù happening and ‚Äúeither \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) happening are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition Law\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A\\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(B) - \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: \\(\\mathfrak{U} = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\\). Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\), and \\(B\\) rolling an even number.\nThe event \\(A \\cap B\\) is therefore the event that we roll a number that is both even and greater than \\(2\\) (i.e.¬†rolling a \\(4\\) or a \\(6\\)). The event \\(A \\cup B\\) is the event that we roll a number that is either greater than \\(2\\), even or both greater than \\(2\\) and even (i.e.¬†rolling a \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) or \\(6\\)).\nFrom this: - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2~\\text{and even}) =\\frac{2}{6}\\) - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2, \\text{even, or both}) = \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent of one another if the probability that one of the events happens is unaffected by whether or not the other one happens. The events are dependent on one another if they are not independent of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nIn the experiment of rolling two dice, the outcome of each dice is not influenced by the outcome of the other dice. This means that each outcome is independent from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nThe event of me taking my umbrella in the morning is influenced by whether or not it is raining. If it is not raining, the probability that I will take an umbrella is smaller than when it is raining. The two events are therefore not independent, i.e. dependent.\n\n\nIf two events are independent, then we have the following rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Law\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events, \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen at the same time. For example, we cannot roll both an even and an odd number on a single die, and so the events ‚Äòrolling an odd number‚Äô and ‚Äòrolling an even number‚Äô are mutually exclusive.\nWe express the mutual exclusion of two events \\(A\\), \\(B\\) mathematically as \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = 0\\).\n\n\n\nWe are often interested in the probability that event \\(A\\) happens given we know some event \\(B\\) has happened, denoted \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Law\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nConditional probabilities themselves are related through Bayes‚Äô Theorem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes‚Äô Theorem\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened can be expressed as \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(B|A)\\mathbb{P}(A)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nThese are algebraic formulae for working with probabilities, though that‚Äôs not the only way to go about it.\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation can be very helpful in understanding probability. We‚Äôve already looked at Venn diagrams so now we‚Äôll turn to trees.\n\n\n\nExample of a tree diagram\n\n\nTree diagrams, also known as probability trees, are particularly useful when there are several events (not necessarily sequential). They are very useful when investigating dependent probabilities.\nNodes (black circles above) represent outcomes or series of outcomes, while edges (the lines between them) represent steps that move from one outcome to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose we a bag containing five counters, of which two are blue and three are red. We randomly choose two counters from the bag, one after the other without replacing the first one in the bag. The possible outcomes are:\n\nchoosing either two red counters,\ntwo blue counters, or\none of each.\n\nIn order to calculate these probabilities it is useful to draw a probability tree. In this, we should consider the possible outcomes of drawing the first counter; and then the outcomes of drawing the second counter (given the counter we picked in our first draw) and the associated probabilities of these different events. ‚ÄòEvent one‚Äô is drawing the first counter and ‚Äòevent two‚Äô is drawing the second counter.\nFor this example we obtain the following probability tree, where the circle on the far left-hand side represents the initial state of the experiment; three red counters and two blue counters in the bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two branches of the tree leaving the initial circle represent the two outcomes of the first part of our experiment, where we pick one counter out of the bag. The event ‚Äòpicking a blue counter‚Äô is represented by the top branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), is shown next to the branch (there are two blue counters out of a total of five counters). The event ‚Äòpicking a red counter‚Äô is represented by the lower branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), is shown next to this branch. Both branches lead to new circles, which represent the state of the experiment after one counter is drawn from the bag at random.\nEach of the two new states have two branches emerging from them. Each branch represents the outcome of having picked either a blue or a red counter on the second turn, and the probability of each outcome is shown next to the branch. The four circles on the far right-hand side of the tree represent the final states of the experiment.\nUsually a probability tree is simplified, without such explicit drawings of the practical situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach path through the tree represents a unique outcome of the experiment. Each path corresponds to independent events. Hence, the probability of each outcome along a given path is calculated by multiplying together the probabilities on each branch of the given path.\nFor instance, the probability of picking two blue counters is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(BB) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]\nThese events (paths) are mutually exclusive, and so the probability of one or the other happening is found by adding the probabilities corresponding to the individual paths. For instance, the probability of picking a red counter on the second go is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{red on 2nd go}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} =\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]"

    "text": "In the previous section we looked at how to model growth mathematically, either with exponential functions in a continuous setting or sequences in a discrete setting. It would be useful to have a way to quantify how fast something was growing, and for that we turn to calculus.\n\n\nConsider the following scenario. You are standing on a bridge, holding a stone that you then drop. You might not be able to picture it exactly, but you might have the intuition that although it starts by falling quite slowly, it accelerates and becomes faster and faster in its fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed at which it falls increases because gravity pulls it towards the ground (centre of the mass of earth). Most of the time we consider the strength of the gravitational pull to be a constant, so the speed at which the stone is accelerating in a linear fashion, i.e. the amount that it speeds up is the same every second. This also means that the increasing speed can be modelled by a linear function (straight line with a positive gradient) and the acceleration by a constant function (a horizontal line).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the distance that it travelled down from where you initially held it? This is clearly also increasing. And it is increasing by the speed that it has. So as the speed increases, the rate of that the displacement increases, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are acceleration, velocity, and distance travelled related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the gradient of a straight line is a constant; the very definition of a straight line is that the \\(y\\) value increases in a constant fashion. That‚Äôs what makes it linear!\nA quadratic is a function that increases, increasingly; its rate of change increases in a linear fashion.\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence of numbers \\[\n  4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a linear fashion by adding \\(3\\) each time. On the other hand, the sequence \\[\n  2, 6, 13, 23, 36, 52, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a quadratic fashion because it increases first by \\(4\\), then by \\(7\\), then \\(10\\), \\(13\\), \\(16\\), and so on by the linear sequence that we just had before.\nThe gradient (or rate of change) of a quadratic is a linear function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of change of velocity is called acceleration. The rate of change of distance travelled (sometimes called displacement) is called velocity.\n\n\n\n\nCalculus is what we call the study of infinitesimal change. This includes differentiation and integration, both of which we will cover over the next couple of sections.\nThe subject has a really long history and, unfortunately for everyone, there was a historical spat between Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton, two famous scientists of the 17th and 18th century, when calculus was developed.\nThey both invented (or discovered depending on your philosophy) calculus around the same time and came up with different notations. To top it off, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, another scientist from that era invented yet more notation for the same ideas:\n\nLeibniz‚Äô notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}y\\),\nNewton‚Äôs notation: \\(\\dot{y}\\),\nLagrange‚Äôs notation: \\(y'\\).\n\nAll three are reasonably common, so it‚Äôs good to be aware of them.\n\n\nWe considered the gradient of a straight line. Now let us generalise this to other types of functions. The derivative at a certain point is the measurement of how much the function increases or decreases at that point. Consider the graph below. Pay attention to how the gradient decreases and increases, where it is negative and where positive.\n\n\n\n\nIn a weird twist of events, the value of the gradient/derivative can also be considered as a function in its own right and we call that function, the ‚Äúgradient function‚Äù and denote it \\(f'(x)\\).\nLet us consider this: the gradient of a graph can itself be represented by a graph. Consider again the parabola:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the gradient function of the parabola is described by a straight line graph. When the gradient of the parabola at its vertex has the value \\(0\\), its gradient function has the \\(y\\) value \\(0\\) (i.e.¬†it intercepts the x-axis). When the parabola is moving up, the straight line has positive \\(y-\\)coordinates (i.e.¬†it‚Äôs above the \\(x-\\)axis. When the graph moves down (the basketball is falling), then the rate of change of its height is negative, so the gradient function is below the \\(x-\\)axis.\nNow we can consider the graph of a cubic and it‚Äôs gradient function (derivative). Move the slider to move point A the cubic graph \\(f(x)\\) to see the corresponding value of the gradient/rate of change/derivative at that point and the corresponding \\(y\\) value of the quadratic gradient/derivative function \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the gradient of the line \\(f(x) = x\\) has a gradient of 1 as each time it goes ‚Äú1 across‚Äù is also ‚Äúgoes one up‚Äù. Note that the graph of \\(f'(x)\\) is \\(f'(x)=1\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, consider the gradients of the following straight lines. Use the slider to change how steep the lines are and observe the graph and value of \\(f'(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see that the gradient of \\(f(x)=cx\\) is going to be \\(c\\). In fact, you already know this fact if you remember \\(y=mx+c\\) where \\(m\\) stands for the gradient and \\(c\\) stands for the y-intercept, the point on the y-axis where the straight line crosses. Since in our example above this is always at the origin, i.e. \\(c = 0\\), this means that the gradient function \\(f'(x)=m\\) for all \\(f(x)=mx\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a line\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(f(x) = mx+c\\). Then \\(f'(x) = m\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x\\) then \\(f'(x)=5\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=9x\\) then \\(f'(x)=9\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=x+91\\) then \\(f'(x)=1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=-x\\) then \\(f'(x)=-1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x\\) then \\(f'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw that the gradient of a straight line is a constant (that we usually call ‚Äú\\(m\\)‚Äù) and which can be represented by a horizontal line \\(y=m\\). We also argued when talking about acceleration that the gradient of a parabola is given by a straight line (i.e. the gradient increases in a linear manner).\nThis can be generalised further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a general integer power.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) where \\(n\\) is a whole number, then its gradient function \\(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\), a polynomial of degree \\(n-1\\).\n\n\nRecall that \\(x^0 = 1\\) for all values of \\(x\\). From this and the above, we also have that a constant function, \\(f(x) = c\\) for all \\(x\\), the gradient is \\(f'(x) = {(c\\times x^{0})}' = c\\times0x^{-1} = 0\\) for all \\(x\\). In other words, the constant function has no gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x^7\\), what is \\(f'(x)\\)?\n\nBy the above, the gradient of \\(x^7\\) is \\(7x^{7-1} = 7x^6\\). Multiplying this by \\(5\\) gives that \\(f'(x)=35x^6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10\\)?\n\nWe can either apply the above rule to each individual term of the polynomial (e.g.¬†\\({(7x^2)}' = 7\\times2x^{2-1}=14x\\)) or computational software. For example, in Wolfram Alpha using derivative of f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10 returns \\(f'(x) = 20x^4 + 14x - 8\\). So the gradient of a polynomial of degree 5 is a polynomial function of power 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this can be further generalised to include cases where \\(n\\) is not an integer (a whole number, either positive or negative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of arbitrary powers\n\n\n\n\\((x^{a})' = ax^{a-1}\\) for any \\(x&gt;0\\) and any \\(a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(y=5x-\\sqrt{x}\\)?\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}\\), it follows from our rules for powers that \\[\n  {(\\sqrt{x})}' = x^{0.5-1} = x^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{x^{0.5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}.\n\\] Then we have that \\(y'=5-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the derivative of \\(f(x) = 4\\sqrt{x}+ \\frac{7}{x} - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\)?\n\nWe note that this can be written as \\(f(x) = 4x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7x^{-1} - x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Then by applying to above rule to each term, \\[\n  f'(x) = 4\\times\\frac{1}{2} \\times x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - 7x^{-2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\times x^{-\\frac{2}{3}}.\n\\] This can be simplified to \\(f'(x)= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{x}}-\\frac{7}{x^2} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven some function that models the velocity of a aeroplane (or comet‚Äôs orbit, a profit curve, etc.), we can find what the velocity is at a certain point of time by substituting a value into the variable. But to know what the acceleration is of the bike, you first need to find the derivative of the function and then substitute the value of the point of time into it.\n\n\nLet the velocity of a particle be described by the function \\(v(t)=4t-t^2\\) where \\(v\\) is the velocity measured in \\(\\text{m/s}\\)and \\(t\\) is the time in seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the initial velocity?\n\nInitial means that \\(t=0\\). So you‚Äôre looking for \\(v(0)\\), i.e. the value when substituting \\(t=0\\) into the function of \\(v(t)\\).\nHere, \\(v(0) = 4\\times0-0^2 = 0\\). We can also type v(t)=4t-t^2 where t=0 into Wolfram Alpha. The initial velocity (speed) is zero meaning that that particle is initially not moving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the initial acceleration?\n\nTo find the initial acceleration, \\(a(0)=v'(0)\\), we first find the derivative to see that \\(v'(t)=4-2t\\) and then substitute \\(t=0\\) into this: \\[\n  v'(0) = 4 - 2t = 4 - 2\\cdot0 = 4.\n\\] So the acceleration is \\(4\\text{m/s}^2\\). The particle is being accelerated forward, the velocity is increasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample C\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the velocity of the particle after one second?\n\nSubstitute \\(t=1\\) into the function of \\(v(t)\\) to obtain \\(v(1)\\). By hand that is \\(v(1) = 4 \\times 1 - (1)^2 = 3 \\text{m/s}\\). Through Wolfram Alpha, this would be 4t-t^2 at t=1. The particle now has a positive velocity, meaning that it is moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample D\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the acceleration after two seconds?\n\nSubstitute \\(t=2\\) into the acceleration to obtain \\(a(2)=v'(2)\\). By hand we can do can do \\(v'(2)=4-2 \\times 2 = 0\\). Alternatively, by Wolfram Alpha, find the derivative of v(t)=4t-t^2 at t=2\nAfter two seconds, the acceleration after two seconds is \\(0 m/s^2\\) meaning that it no longer accelerates the particle. This means that the velocity is no longer increasing.\n\n\nPulling all these examples together, here is a graph of the velocity.\n\n\n\nPlot with \\(t\\) on the horizontal axis and \\(v(t)\\) on the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis idea of of the derivative giving the gradient can be extended to other functions that we have looked at so far. Before we look at those however, it will be useful to state some rules that will help us.\n\n\nGiven two functions, \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), there are several key rules for working out what the derivatives of different combinations of those two functions might be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a composition of two functions, \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = f'(g(x))\\times g'(x).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a product of two functions \\(h(x) = f(x)g(x)\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotient Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a ratio of two functions \\(h(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = \\frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the gradient of the sine graph. Again, pay particular attention to the places where the gradient of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is equal to zero.\n\n\n\n\nNotice how there are some places where the gradient is zero. What is special about these places? There are some values where the gradient is positive, and some where it‚Äôs negative. And this repeats periodically.\nWhat graph or function do you know that has periodicity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nFor the trig functions:\n\n\\(y = \\sin(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = \\cos(x)\\)\n\\(y = \\cos(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = -\\sin(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)= 4x + sin(3x)\\), find \\(f'(x)\\).\n\nWe know from the above that the derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(\\cos(x)\\), and the derivative of \\(3x\\) is \\(3\\). Letting \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(g(x) = 3x\\) gives the composition \\(f(g(x)) = \\sin(3x)\\). Then, by the chain rule, the derivative of the composition is\\[\n  f'(g(x))\\times g'(x) = \\cos(3x)\\times 3 = 3\\cos(3x).\n\\] We can also find that by typing in differentiate f(x) = 4x + sin(3x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nThe height of the tide in a harbour can be modelled by the graph \\(H(t)=4.8 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}(t+3)) + 5.1\\) where \\(H(t)\\) is measured in metres and \\(t\\) is measured in hours after midnight. What is the curve that models the rate of change in the tide?\n\nThe rate of change (i.e. how rapidly the tide comes in and flows out) is given by \\[H'(t)= -2.5132\\times\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t\\right).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember when we considered Douglas‚Äô coffee cooling down from a fictional \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\)? Initially, the rate at which is was cooling down was quite rapid. This was because the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air became smaller (decreased), the rate at which the coffee continued to cool down slowed down.\nAs the coffee neared the temperature of the surrounding air, a fictional \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\), the coffee would stop cooling down as there was now very little difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature.\nConsider the following interactive graph. Move the point A. As time increases, the \\(y\\) ‚ÄúTemperature‚Äù value decreases as the temperature of the tea is decreasing. The gradient is therefore negative (you can see the value).\nThe gradient function is represented by the blue graph. You can see that it remains below the \\(x-\\)axis even as it comes closer and closer to the \\(x-\\)axis. This represents the fact that although the tea (or coffee) keeps getting colder (as it approaches the ambient temperature), the rate of decrease becomes more and more smaller.\n\n\n\n\nYou might be able to see that, even if the blue graph is upside down, it has the same general shape as the green graph which represents the temperature of Douglas‚Äô coffee. In fact, the gradient of an exponential function is another exponential function. The rate of change of a quantity that increases or decreases in an exponential fashion is itself exponential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nLet \\(y=2^x\\). Use the command differentiate y=2^x to obtain the answer: \\(y'=2^x log(2)\\) or if you use the approximate values: \\(y' =0.693147 2^x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(f(x)=18 \\times 9.1x^{3x}+7x\\). Use the command differentiate f(x)=18  9.1^(3x) +7x to obtain \\(f'(x) = 119.247 \\times 9.1^{3x} + 7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about the natural exponential function in a previous week. Part of what makes these particularly important for growth models from biology or economics is the following property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nIf \\(y = e^x\\), then \\(y' = e^x\\) also. That is, the natural exponential is a function where the graph of the function and the graph of its gradient are the same.\n\n\nWe can then combine this with the other rules to work out exponential derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(h(x)=18 \\times e^{3x}+11\\). This can be differentiated using the chain rule, where \\(f(x) = 18e^x + 11\\) (so \\(f'(x) = 18e^x\\)) and \\(g(x) = 3x\\) (so \\(g'(x) = 3\\)).\nWe get \\[\n  h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 18e^{g(x)}\\times3 = 54e^{3x}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample C\n\n\n\nLet \\(y = 4 - 5e^{\\frac{1}{2}x}\\). Find the value of the gradient of this function when \\(x = 9\\). Use differentiate 4 - 5*exp(-0.5x) at x=9 to obtain -(5 e^(9/2))/2, or the approximate form: \\(-225.043\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization is the process of finding the maximum and/or minimum value of a function. If the function is posed as part of a problem, such a value is often referred to as the optimal solution.\n\n\nWhen we studied parabolas we looked at the maximum or minimum value that the vertical value of a graph could take by finding the vertex (e.g. the height of a thrown basketball). Now we can generalise this because differentiation allows us to find these points for many more graphs.\n\n\n\n\nTo find the maxima (plural of maximum) or minima (plural of minimum) of a graph you need to consider what is happening to the function‚Äôs gradient.\nLook again at the graph above. You can see that at the extrema (maxima or minima), the graph ‚Äúturns around‚Äù (one reason we call them turning points also). Either the graph is going down and then back up or it is increasing and then, after the turning point, decreasing again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese maxima and minima are the points where the gradient is zero, so can be found by solving \\(f'(x) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThink back to our example of acceleration \\(a(t)\\), velocity \\(v(t)\\), and distance \\(d(t)\\). There we talked about how velocity was the rate of change in distance with respect to time, and how acceleration was the change in velocity with respect to time. With this, can we connect acceleration and distance?\nSince \\(v(t) = d'(t)\\) and \\(a(t) = v'(t)\\), we could substitute the first equation into the second to get that \\[\n  a(t) = (v(t))' = (d'(t))'.\n\\] In other words, we define acceleration b as the derivative of the derivative of the distance with respect to time. This is what is called a second derivative.\nIn the various notations discussed earlier these would be:\n\nLeibniz‚Äô notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}^2}{\\text{d}x^2}y\\),\nNewton‚Äôs notation: \\(\\ddot{y}\\),\nLagrange‚Äôs notation: \\(y''\\).\n\nWe can extend this idea to the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) derivative (i.e. what comes after taking the derivative of a function \\(n\\) times). This is usually denoted by \\(f^{(n)}(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{\\text{d}^{n}y}{\\text{d}x^n}\\) since the other two notations get complicated for \\(n&gt;3\\).\nThe main use of higher derivatives is to find whether given extrema are maxima or minima without having to graph the function. If \\(f''(x) &gt; 0\\), the point at \\(x\\) is a minimum. If \\(f''(x) &lt; 0\\), the point is a maximum."

    "text": "Way back when you first learnt about powers, remember ‚Äò\\(a\\) to the power of \\(b\\)‚Äô was defined as \\(a\\) multiplied together \\(b\\) times: \\[\n  a^b = \\underbrace{a \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times a}_{b~\\text{times}}.\n\\] Similar to how addition and multiplication are an operation between two numbers, we can think of taking powers as an operation called exponentiation.\n\n\nRecall the algebraic laws that we use for simplifying powers, given some number \\(a\\) and powers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\).\n\n\n\nRule\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\)\n\\(2^3\\times2^4 = 2^{3+4}\\)\n\n\n\\({(a^m)}^n = a^{m\\times n}\\)\n\\({(2^3)}^4 = 2^{3\\times 4}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2^3}{2^4} = 2^{3-4}\\)\n\n\n\\(a^0 = 1\\)\n\\(2^0 = 1\\)\n\n\n\\(a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^m}\\)\n\\(2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{2^3}\\)\n\n\n\nWe also know how taking roots undoes taking powers. If \\(a^n = b\\), then we say the \\(n\\)th root of \\(b\\) is \\(a\\), or \\(\\sqrt[n]{b} = a\\) in notation. For example, if \\(x^3 = 8\\) we would say \\(x = \\sqrt[3]{8}\\).\nBut what happens if we know the number \\(a\\) but don‚Äôt know the power \\(n\\) we‚Äôve taken it to?\n\n\nGiven there numbers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(n\\) where \\[\n  b = a^n = \\underbrace{a \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times a}_{n~\\text{times}}.\n\\] we can use the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) root to find \\(a\\), denoted \\[\n  a = \\sqrt[n]{b},\n\\] and the base-\\(a\\) logarithm (or log for short) to find \\(n\\), denoted \\[\n  n = \\log_{a}(b).\n\\]\nThe button for this function appears on your calculator as \\(\\log_{\\square}\\blacksquare\\). This shouldn‚Äôt be confused with the ‚Äò\\(\\log\\)‚Äô button, which is a shortcut for \\(\\log_{10}\\blacksquare\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(3^x = 81\\), what is \\(x\\)?\n\nThis would be calculated as \\(x = \\log_{3}(81) = 4\\). We can check this as \\[\n  3^4 = 3\\times3\\times3\\times3 = 81.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to how the index laws describe the rules of powers and roots, we can also take logarithms to derive a set of log laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex Rule\nLog Law\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\)\n\\(\\log_{a}(mn) = \\log_a(m) + \\log_a(n)\\)\n\n\n\\({(a^m)}^n = a^{m\\times n}\\)\n\\(\\log_{a}{\\left(m^n\\right)} = n\\times\\log_{a}(m)\\)\n\n\n\\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\)\n\\(\\log_{a}{\\left(\\frac{m}{n}\\right)} = \\log_{a}(m) - \\log_{a}(n)\\)\n\n\n\\(a^0 = 1\\)\n\\(\\log_{a}(1) = 1\\)\n\n\n\\(a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^m}\\)\n\\(\\log_{a}\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = -\\log_{a}(n)\\)\n\n\n\nBe aware in particular that a number multiplied by a log is typically written without a ‚Äò\\(\\times\\)‚Äô, ‚Äò\\(\\cdot\\)‚Äô, or any other specific symbol for multiplication (similar to \\(a\\times b = ab\\)). That is, \\(n\\times\\log_{a}(m)\\) may be written as \\(n\\log_{a}m\\) in other resources.\n\n\n\nTied to exponentials and logarithms is the definition of Euler‚Äôs number, denoted \\(e\\). This is another one of those important irrational numbers like the number \\(\\pi\\). We will explore why it is so important a little later on in the course, but for now, here is the approximate value of it: \\[\n  e = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995\\dots.\n\\] Just as we often use \\(\\pi\\approx3.14\\), we also often use \\(e\\approx2.72\\) as a sufficient approximation.\nWe say that \\(y = e^x\\) is the standard exponential graph, where \\(e\\) is Euler‚Äôs number.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating this as a function \\(f(x) = e^x\\), using our inversion technique from the previous section, we can see that \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\log_{e}(x)\\). This is called the natural logarithm, and is often denoted \\(\\ln{x}\\).\n\n\n\n\nExponentials are very useful for modelling natural phenomena. Imagine you just boiled the kettle and poured cup of tea. As mathematicians are wont to do, simplify the problem by assuming that the water boiled at \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) and the tea that you poured is still at that temperature. You can imagine that the tea will cool down. Let our independent variable be time \\(t\\) and our dependant variable be temperature \\(T\\).\nCould we model \\(T\\) using a straight line? This would mean that the temperature decreases at a constant rate‚Ä¶ eventually freezing‚Ä¶ so perhaps not such a good model. How about as a quadratic? Well, the temperature could initially fall until it hits a turning point and then the temperature could increase again‚Ä¶ well perhaps not a good model either.\nThe type of graph we need is one that initially represents a rapid decrease of temperature which then gradually slows down. Until ‚Ä¶ the temperature of the tea balanced out with the surrounding ambient temperature of \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\).1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the graph intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at 100 which represents the starting temperature. It then quickly decreases (because the large difference between the tea‚Äôs temperature and the surrounding temperature means that there is a rapid exchange of temperature). As the difference decreases, the rate of cooling also slows and it flattens out at the temperature reaches \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\).\nLook at the equation \\(f(x) = 79e^{0.3x} + 21\\). The ‚Äò\\(+21\\)‚Äô means that the graph will level out as it approaches the horizontal asymptote \\(y = 21\\) because we assumed that the ambient room temperature is \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\). The ‚Äò\\(0.3x\\)‚Äô determines the rate of change. The ‚Äò\\(79\\)‚Äô together with the ‚Äò\\(+21\\)‚Äô gives the initial temperature of \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\). As before, \\(e\\) is Euler‚Äôs number.\n\n\nMore generally, the exponential curve looks like in the interactive GeoGebra file below. Change the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to see how they effect the shape of the graph. Consider the following questions:\n\nWhich parameter controls the horizontal asymptote (the horizontal pink line)?\nWhich parameter controls where the graph intersects the y-axis?\nWhich parameter controls how fast the graph increases? (how tight the ‚Äúbend‚Äù is)\n\n\n\n\n\nExponential functions can be written in the form \\(f(x)= a \\cdot b^{cx+d}+h\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and \\(h\\) are the parameters and \\(x\\), \\(y\\) are the variables. The horizontal asymptote is given by \\(y = h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWith \\(b=0\\), a strange graph is produced; that‚Äôs because Geogebra is trying to plot something like \\(0^{x}\\) and runs into the issue of \\(0^0\\) being undefined. Domains are important!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key use of exponential models is in the growth of populations. In the Geogebra applet below, try changing the parameters in the exponential function to model the total population in Ethiopia.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not that straight-forward! One thing to consider is what the horizontal asymptote could be.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find the intersection point between exponential graphs, or equivalent the solution to equations that involve exponentials. However, this isn‚Äôt as simple as it might at first seem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the point of intersection A of \\(y=2^x\\) and \\(y=3^{1-x}+1\\).\n\nSince we‚Äôre looking for the point of intersection between the two graphs, we are solving a simultaneous equation where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must satisfy both equations: \\(y=2^x\\) and \\(y=3^{1-x}+1\\). This results in the equation \\(2^x = 3^{1-x}+1\\) which we might think to solve algebraically.\n\n\n\nEquation\nStep\n\n\n\n\n\\(2^x = 3^{1-x}+1\\)\nSetting \\(y\\) values to be equal.\n\n\n\\(2^x = \\frac{3}{3^x} + 1\\)\nUsing the index law for subtraction\n\n\n\\(2^x\\cdot3^x = 3 + 3^x\\)\nMultiplying both sides by \\(3^x\\).\n\n\n\\(6^x = 3 + 3^x\\)\nBy grouping powers and simplifying.\n\n\n\nHowever, at this point it‚Äôs unclear how we would proceed. Taking log base-6 will neaten up the left-hand side but make the right-hand side a mess, and vice versa if we take log base-3. It turns out this problem doesn‚Äôt have a neat algebraic method for finding its solution.\nInstead, we could find it analytically by looking at the properties of the two curves or geometrically by comparing their plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could find it computationally using methods such as those used by Wolfram Alpha. Using intersection between y=2^x and y=3^(1-x})+1 gives the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of intersection is therefore \\((2,1)\\). The solution of the equation \\(2^x =3^{1-x}+1\\) alone is just the value of \\(x\\). The solution of the equation would therefore be \\(x=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(a^x = b^x\\), what is \\(x\\)?\n\nWe might think that this equation similarly cannot be answered algebraically, but using log laws there is actually a way forward this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation\nStep\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^x = b^x\\)\nOriginal equation.\n\n\n\\(\\log(a^x) = \\log(b^x)\\)\nTaking logs of both sides.\n\n\n\\(x\\log(a) = x\\log(b)\\)\nUsing the log law for powers.\n\n\n\\(x\\log(a) - x\\log(b) = 0\\)\nMoving both non-zero terms to the same side.\n\n\n\\(x\\left(\\log(a) - \\log(b)\\right) = 0\\)\nTaking out a factor of \\(x\\).\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(\\log(a) - \\log(b) = 0\\)\nUsing \\(f\\cdot{}g=0\\) if and only if \\(f=0\\) or \\(g=0\\)\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(\\log(a) = \\log(b)\\)\nRearranging the second situation.\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(a = b\\)\nUndoing the log on both sides.\n\n\n\nIn other words, our solutions to this problem are \\(x = 0\\) if \\(a\\neq b\\) or any value of \\(x\\) if \\(a = b\\).\n\n\nTogether, these examples highlight that solving equations that involve exponentials or logs isn‚Äôt so straightforward, and that even if it can be solved algebraically there may be different situations in the same problem.\n\n\n\nRemember that graphs can be transformed in four basic ways:\n\nTranslated vertically\nTranslated horizontally\nStretched vertically\nStretched horizontally\n\nLet us consider the graph of any old function \\(y = f(x)\\). Play around with the GeoGebra graphs below by changing the values of \\(a, b, c, d\\):\n\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see the following:\n\n\\(y = a\\cdot{}f(x)\\) results in a vertical stretch by a factor of \\(a\\).\n\\(y = f(b\\cdot{}x)\\) results in a horizontal stretch by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\).\n\\(y = f(x+c)\\) results in a horizontal translation by \\(-c\\) units.\n\\(y = f(x)+d\\) results in a vertical translating by \\(d\\) units.\n\nAdding a parameter translates; multiplying by a parameter stretches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTransforming the \\(x\\) value in the expression of \\(f(x)\\) results in a horizontal stretch or translation in the opposite way than you might think (by \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\) and \\(-c\\)). It‚Äôs always worth double checking you have this the right way around!\n\n\n\n\nRecall that \\(y = e^x\\) is the standard exponential graph where \\(e\\) is the Euler‚Äôs number.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery other exponential graph can be expressed as a transformation of this graph, with \\(y = e^{b(x-c)}+d\\) acting as a ‚Äògeneral form‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us shift it to the right: \\(y = e^{x-2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove it up - and with it the horizontal asymptote too: \\(y = e^x + 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlip it around the \\(y\\)-axis: \\(y=e^{-x}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a combination of a few of these: \\(y = -e^{2x}+4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn workshops we‚Äôll explore how some of these ideas (exponentials and logs both) can be used practically in modelling real world concepts."

    "text": "Linear equations and quadratics are two useful ways to algebraically describe the relationship between variables. You might also be familiar with more complicated algebraic expressions for structures like hyperbolae and ellipses, which have forms like \\[\n  \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \\quad   \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.\n\\] While these specific examples do enable a broader range of modelling, but point to a more general idea for defining algebraic relationships.\n\n\nIn school, the idea of functions is often introduced early on through the concept of a ‚Äòfunction machine‚Äô. This is some imagined box which takes in some number \\(x\\) as an input, carries out some operation \\(f\\) and then returns another number \\(y\\) as output.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, this would be denoted \\(f:x \\rightarrow y\\) or \\(y = f(x)\\) which would be read as ‚Äú\\(y\\) equals \\(f\\) of \\(x\\)‚Äù or ‚Äúthe function \\(f\\) applied to \\(x\\)‚Äù. As an example of how this might look in practice, the function \\(f(x) = 2x\\) maps values to their double. If \\(x = 7\\) for instance, the output of the function will be \\(f(2) = 14\\).\nFunctions are an important concept in mathematics, and they describe many natural and human-made phenomena. The speed of growth of a plant for instance is a function of (amongst other factors), the temperature of the weather.\n\n\nAside from the relationship between variables, essential to this idea of functions is the set of values that it‚Äôs possible to use as inputs or receive as outputs. This is reflected in the full mathematical definition of a function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nA function is a relationship that maps elements from one set \\(A\\) to another set \\(B\\), where each element in \\(A\\) is uniquely associated with an element in \\(B\\). This may be denoted \\(f:A\\rightarrow{}B\\).\n\n\nHere, the first set of values \\(A\\) is called the domain, and can be thought of as the set of valid inputs for \\(f\\). The second set of values \\(B\\) is called the codomain, and can be thought of as the type of numbers we expect to get out of \\(f\\). Linked to that is the range; this is the subset of all codomain values that are actually received as outputs.\nFor example, consider the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) where \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\). This function takes any real number as an input, and returns another real number as the output; its domain is the reals, and the codomain is the reals. However square numbers are always positive, so the range of \\(f\\) is restricted to the positive real numbers.\nSometimes it is easier to think of where a function is not defined, rather than when it is. For instance, the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers (e.g.¬†\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is not a real number). Similarly, dividing by zero is not meaningful, so \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is not defined for \\(x=0\\).\nIn theory (but not always in practice) a function should always have it‚Äôs domain specified. For example, strictly speaking we should say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\geq 0\\rbrace,\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\ne 0\\rbrace.\\]\n\n\n\nWhile the domain may be restricted because the graph is only defined for certain values, we may also restrict it because in the context of the real-world problem some answers do not make sense. For example, if we wishes to use out function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) to find integer squares we could define its domain as \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), rather than \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nWe are constructing a rabbit enclosure from \\(60 m\\) of fence. With only this fence, we want to make the largest possible rectangular enclosure for our bunny. One side of the enclosure is against the wall so we don‚Äôt need any fence on that side.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraically, we can write that we are aiming to maximize the enclosure‚Äôs area \\(L\\times{}W\\) and that our solution must satisfy \\(L + 2W = 60\\). However, since \\(L\\) and \\(W\\) represent lengths of fence in the real world they must also be positive numbers.\nThis is an example of a domain restriction. Any results in our calculations that includes a negative length or area cannot be valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nIn the GeoGebra Applet below, restrict the domain so that the function models the path of the basketball only (i.e. it should not pass beyond the path of the ball).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince functions take one value and map it to another, we can also consider how to take the result back to the original value. Consider the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) over the domain \\(\\lbrace 10, 2, 3, -3\\rbrace\\).\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n\\(x^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n10\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n100\n\n\n2\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n4\n\n\n3\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n9\n\n\n-3\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n9\n\n\n\nFrom what we know about quadratics, square rooting would be the answer in this case. But in general, are there functions that can map the numbers on the right-hand side of the table back to the left-hand side?\nMost mathematical operations have an inverse operation; addition can be undone by subtraction, and multiplication by division. The same is true of a function, it‚Äôs just a case of finding its inverse.\nThe general method1 is to:\n\nwrite \\(f(x)\\) as \\(y\\),\nswap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nrearrange the subject of the formula to \\(y\\) again,\nreplace the \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse operation of the function \\(f(x) = 5x - 7\\).‚Äù\n\nFirst we write this as \\(y = 5x - 7\\). Then we swap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to get \\(x = 5y - 7\\). We must now rearrange it to make \\(y\\) the subject, i.e. to put it in the form $y = $ some function of \\(x\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n                            x &= 5y-7 \\\\\n                          x+7 &= 5y \\\\\n                \\frac{x+7}{5} &= y \\\\\n   \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{7}{5} &= y\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFinally, replacing \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) gives that the inverse function of \\(f(x) = 5x-7\\) is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1}{5}x+ \\frac{7}{5}\\). This means that if you send a number into \\(f(x)\\), say \\(10\\)\n\\[\n  f(10) = 5 \\times 10 -7 = 43\n\\]\nand then apply \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) to the result it will return to \\(10\\),\n\\[\n  f^{-1}(43) = \\frac{43+7}{5} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10.\n\\]\nVoila! You can also use Wolfram Alpha to find an inverse by typing in inverse of y=5x-7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 + 7}{5}\\).\n\nWe work through this using ‚Äútwo column working‚Äù in the table below.\n\n\n\nEquation\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{3y^2 + 7}{5} = x\\)\nAfter the initial swap.\n\n\n\\(3y^2 + 7 = 5x\\)\nMultiply both sides by \\(5\\).\n\n\n\\(3y^2 = 5x - 7\\)\nSubtract \\(7\\) from both sides.\n\n\n$y^2 = $\nDivide both sides by \\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x - 7}{3}}\\)\nTake the square root on both sides.\n\n\n\nTherefore \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x-7}{3}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we have two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) we can form the composition \\(f(g(x))\\), sometimes denoted \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\)). This is read aloud as ‚Äú\\(f\\) of \\(g\\) of \\(x\\)‚Äù.\nWhen evaluating these we work outwards from the innermost brackets. Here, given a number \\(x\\), we first apply \\(g\\) to \\(x\\) to get the value \\(g(x)\\), and then we apply \\(f\\) to the number \\(g(x)\\) to get the number \\(f(g(x))\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x) = x^2 +1\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x + 3\\), express the composites \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\) explicitly as functions of \\(x\\).\n\nBy definition we have that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n   f(g(x)) &= f (2x + 3) \\\\\n           &= (2x + 3)^2 + 1 \\\\\n           &= 4x^2 + 12x + 9 + 1 \\\\\n           &= 4x^2 + 12x + 10.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSimilarly, we have that \\[\\begin{align*}\n   g(f(x)) & = g( x^2 + 1) \\\\\n           &= 2 (x^2 + 1) + 3 \\\\\n           & = 2x^2 + 2 + 3 \\\\\n           &= 2x^2 + 5.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotice these two functions are different functions, e.g.¬†\\(f(g(0)) = 10\\) but \\(g(f(0)) = 5\\). The order is crucial!\n\n\nAt time of writing, Wolfram Alpha does not have function composition capabilities, though the software it is based on does.\n\n\nOther than the idea of a function feeding into another function being a useful one to understand (for instance when you consider machine learning and biological processes), it will also be a useful skill when we come to differentiation.\nFor example, consider \\((\\color{red}{5x+8})^2\\). Here the expression \\(5x+8\\) is nested within another function. We can think of it as the ‚Äúinside‚Äù function. The outside function is \\(x^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if, for example, we were asked to decompose \\(g(f(x)) = (5x+8)^2\\) then a possible answer might be \\(f(x)=5x+8\\) and \\(g(x)=x^2\\)."

    "text": "We have talked about how exponentials can model growth, but in our day to day we don‚Äôt always encounter growth in this continuous way as a curve. Rather, we encounter it in a discrete way as a sequence.\n\n\nSay I set myself a New Years resolution of reading more. At the moment I read about 3 pages per night, but I have the idea to increase this by two pages every day in January. On the January 1st I‚Äôll read 5 pages, on Jan 2nd read 7 pages, on Jan 3rd read 9 pages, and so on. The number of pages I will is a sequence: \\[\n  5, 7, 9, \\ldots.\n\\]\nThe \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) term in a sequence is denoted \\(a_n\\), so here \\(a_1 = 5\\), \\(a_2 = 7\\), etc. By observation we might be able to see that on the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) day I will have read \\(3+2n\\) pages, so here \\(a_n = 3+2n\\).\nThis means that we can work out a given term in the sequence without calculating all the intermediate terms. For example, on January 31st I‚Äôll read \\(a_{31} = 3 + 2\\times31 = 65\\) pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nIn general, We define the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) term of an arithmetic sequence as \\(a_n = a_0 + nd\\), where \\(a_0\\) is our starting value and \\(d\\) is the difference we move by each term.\n\n\nSo in the reading previous example, \\(a_0 = 3\\) and \\(d = 2\\).\nSuppose now I want to find how many pages \\(S\\) I will read in January total. This would be the \\[\n  S = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{31}.\n\\] We could compute this by hand, but there exists a handy formula \\[\n  S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{n} = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nThis sum is called an arithmetic series and you may also see this sum denoted using ‚Äòsigma‚Äô notation \\[\n  S_n = \\sum_{m=1}^{n} a_m = \\frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}.\n\\]\n\n\nFor my reading goal, that means \\[\n  S_{31} = \\sum_{n=1}^{31}(3+2n) = \\frac{31(5 + 65)}{2} = \\frac{31\\times70}{2} = 1085.\n\\] That‚Äôs almost the same number of pages as War and Peace, so probably not realistic as resolutions go!\n\n\n\nAnother context where growth comes up is in savings or interest. Say I put \\(\\text{¬£}50\\) in a savings account with 2% annual interest. That is, at the end of the year 2% of the total balance is added extra by the bank.\nAt the end of the first year, it will contain \\(\\text{¬£}50 + 2\\%\\times\\text{¬£}50 = \\text{¬£}50 + \\text{¬£}1 = \\text{¬£}51\\). Next year though, \\(2\\%\\) of my balance isn‚Äôt \\(\\text{¬£}1\\) any more, it‚Äôs \\(2\\%\\times\\text{¬£}51 = \\text{¬£}1.02\\).\nBy remembering that increasing by \\(2\\%\\) is the same as multiply by \\(1 + \\frac{2}{100} = 1.02\\), we can put To put it back in the language of sequences as \\[\\begin{align*}\n  a_0 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\\\\n  a_1 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_2 &= (\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_3 &= ((\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] or, simplifying using powers, \\(a_n = \\text{¬£50}\\times{1.02}^n\\). That means in thirty five years my savings pot will be a whole \\[\n  a_{35} = 50\\times1.02^{35} = 99.99448.\n\\] Well, \\(\\text{¬£}99.99\\) isn‚Äôt nothing, but it‚Äôs certainly not a retirement fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nIn general, We define the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) term of an geometric sequence as \\(a_n = a_0 \\times r^n\\), where \\(a_0\\) is our starting value and \\(r\\) is the common ratio we increase by each term.\n\n\nIn the previous example, \\(a_0 = 50\\) and \\(r = 1.02\\). Similar to before, we can compute the sum of these terms - the geometric series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\n\\[\n  S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_{n} = \\frac{a_0(1-r^n)}{1-r}.\n\\] This formula doesn‚Äôt hold when \\(r = 1\\) since it would require dividing by zero, though in that case the value of \\(S_n\\) can be worked out directly from its definition.\n\n\n\n\nGeometric series with \\(r &gt; 1\\) are often used to model exponential growth. For example, what if \\(a_0 = 2\\), \\(r = 2\\) then the initially small numbers will increase initially slowly but faster and faster: \\[\n  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nWith each step, the increase is twice as large as the previous step."

This is just one aspect of calculus though, the other being integration.\n\n\nMany operations in mathematics have ‚Äúinverse operations‚Äù (the mathematical version of CTRL+Z).\n\n\n\nOperation\nInverse Operation\n\n\n\n\n\\(+\\)\n\\(-\\)\n\n\n\\(\\times\\)\n\\(\\div\\)\n\n\n\\(\\square^{2}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{\\square}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\square^{3}\\)\n\\(\\sqrt[3]{\\square}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\sin(x)\\)\n\\(\\arcsin(x)\\)\n\n\n\\(e^x\\)\n\\(\\ln(x)\\)\n\n\n\\(2^x\\)\n\\(\\log_{2}x\\)\n\n\n\nThis means for instance that if you add 2 to a number, subtracting 2 from it will bring you back to the original number. If you square a number, for instance \\(9^2\\), you obtain \\(81\\). If you square root the \\(81\\), \\((\\sqrt{81})\\), you return back to \\(9\\).\nDifferentiation also has it‚Äôs ‚Äúundo‚Äù operation, called integration. Sometimes an integral is actually known as the ‚Äúanti-derivative‚Äù because it is in a way the inverse operation to differentiation.\n\n\nThe integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) is a function whose derivative is \\(f(x)\\). So if \\(f'(x)\\) is the derivative of function \\(f(x)\\), then \\(f(x)\\) is the integral of \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nOften the integral is denoted using a capital letter; \\(F(x)\\) is the integral of \\(f(x)\\). This means that \\(F'(x)=f(x)\\).\n\n\nThis creates a relationship whereby each operation undoes the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\nFind an integral of \\(f(x)\\) where \\(f(x)=\\cos(x)\\).\n\nSince \\((\\sin(x))' = \\cos(x)\\), we have that \\(\\sin(x)\\) is an integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs also true that \\((\\sin(x)+5)' = \\cos(x)\\). So it must be that \\(\\sin(x)+5\\) is also an integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\). In fact, there are an infinite number of possible integrals!\nTo give us a unique answer, we need to write \\(F(x) = \\sin(x) + C\\) where \\(C\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is a constant. This ‚Äú\\(+C\\)‚Äù is called a constant of integration and is something we‚Äôll add every time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen differentiating we mentioned that there were a whole bunch of different notations people used. For integration, there‚Äôs pretty much just one: \\(\\int~\\text{d}x\\).1 The function that will be integrated, \\(f(x)\\), is called the integrand, and the variable \\(x\\) in the \\(\\text{d}x\\) is the variable we are integrating with respect to.\nThis is put together with the \\(f(x)\\) and \\(F(x)\\) from above to give \\[\n  \\int{f(x)}~\\text{d}x = F(x) + C.\n\\] In Wolfram Alpha the keyword integrate or int is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTo use Wolfram Alpha to find that \\[\\int{2^{3x}-4 \\cos(6x)~dx} = \\frac{8^x}{\\ln(8)} - \\frac{2}{3} \\sin(6x) + C,\\] we write integrate 2^(3x)-4cos(6x) and get the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that Wolfram Alpha and some tools like it use ‚Äò\\(\\log\\)‚Äô to mean \\(\\ln\\), rather than log base-10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we differentiated, there was always just one gradient for a given function. However we‚Äôve seen that the same doesn‚Äôt hold for integration in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nWhat we‚Äôve seen so far is so-called indefinite integration, \\(\\displaystyle\\int f(x)~\\text{d}x = F(x) + C\\).\n\n\nConsider the interactive graph below. There are three parabolas. You can move the red one up and down by changing the value of \\(c\\). Move the blue point and see how the gradient changes.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that all three parabolas have the same gradient \\(2x\\) where \\(x\\) is the \\(x-\\)coordinate of the point where the gradient is being measured. In other words, given \\(f(x)\\), there‚Äôs an infinite number of graphs/functions that have this particular gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo without more information, we cannot know what constant disappeared when we differentiated and should reappear when we integrate. That is why we have to add ‚Äú\\(+C\\)‚Äù at the end of the integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nReturning to the example above, we can write the indefinite integral \\(\\int 2x~\\text{d}x = x^2 + C\\) where the ‚Äú\\(+C\\)‚Äù means that we not know which of the parabolas we need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nGenerally, for \\(f(x) = x^n\\) where \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(F(x) = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} +C\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinite integration, or integration between two limits, returns a specific value rather than a function. Instead of the ‚Äú\\(+C\\)‚Äù we use square brackets and substitute limits into the integral: \\[\n  \\int_b^a f(x)~\\text{d}x = {[F(x)]}^a_b = F(a) - F(b)\n\\]\nYou will not need to know how to write this, but you will need to interpret what the notation represents. The most direct reason that we use this technique is to calculate the area underneath a curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light grey area from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = c\\) can be represented by \\[\\int_a^c f(x)~\\text{d}x = [F(x)]^a_c = F(c)-F(a).\\] The blue area is represented by \\[\\int_c^b f(x)~\\text{d}x = [F(x)]_c^b = F(b)-F(c).\\] See how adding these together gives \\(F(b) - F(a)\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nGiven three values \\(a \\leq c \\leq b\\), then the \\[\n  \\int_a^b f(x)~\\text{d}x = \\int_a^c f(x)~\\text{d}x + \\int_c^b f(x)~\\text{d}x.\n\\]\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not something we‚Äôll get into much in this course, but this ‚Äòsplitting‚Äô can be very useful when the domain contains a point that might cause trouble (e.g. \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) over \\([-1,1]\\), which includes \\(x = 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph \\(y=6x^2 -9x+7\\) for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 8\\).\n\nThere are a few different Wolfram Alpha commands that could get us what we want\n\narea under y=6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8,\nintegrate 6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8,\nintegrate 6x^2 -9x+7, from 0 to 8.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter which we choose, all will return equivalent outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area underneath the graph is \\(792~\\text{unit}^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph of \\(y = 5 - x\\) between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 5\\).\n\nIf we use integrate 5-x, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 5, we get the following output.\n\nWith our understanding so far, this would mean the area underneath the graph is \\(-12.5 \\text{units}^2\\): a negative area! This is because it is below the \\(x\\)-axis. How this is interpreted will depend on the application of the problem.\n\n\nIn some applications, such as design or architecture, the area should never be negative. In others, where the area represents velocity or accumulated profit, then negative area has a legitimate interpretation as growing loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nApplying integration to solve a problem like this is sometimes overkill! This area could have been calculated using the formula of area of a triangle \\(A=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{base}\\times\\text{height}\\). In this case it would have been \\[A = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot{}5\\cdot{}5 = 12.5~\\text{units}^2.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially when working with real world problems, we sometimes have additional information about \\(f(x)\\), \\(f'(x)\\), and/or \\(F(x)\\). This information can help find a specific function when integrating, rather than a family of functions connected by a \\(+C\\). This is called an initial value problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(f'(x)=6x+1\\). It is given that \\(f(5)=14\\). Find the expression for \\(f(x)\\).\n\nFirst, find the indefinite integral: \\(f(x) = \\int 6x+1~\\text{d}x = 3x^2 + x + C\\). Then substitute in the initial values to find the value of \\(C\\).\nSince we are told that \\(f(5)=14\\) we need to substitute \\(x=5\\) into the expression and set it equal to \\(14\\). That is \\(3(5)^2 + 5 + C = 14\\) which after simplifying and rearranging gives \\(C = -66\\).\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip title=‚ÄúExample B‚Äù}\n\nThe acceleration of a particle is given by \\(a(t)=8t^3 - 5t +9\\). It is known that the velocity of the initial velocity of the particle is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\). Find the function of the velocity.\n\nWe find that the indefinite integral is \\[\n  v(t) = \\int a(t)~\\text{d}t = \\int 8t^3 - 5t + 9~\\text{d}t = 2t^4 - \\frac{5}{2}t^2 + 9t + C.\n\\] The question tells us that the initial velocity is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\); this means that \\(v(0) = 5\\). Substituting and solving as before, we find that \\(C = 5\\).\nTherefore the function for the velocity is \\(v(t)=2t^4 - \\frac52 t^2 + 9t + 5\\).\n\n\n\nSo far, we‚Äôve only looked at how to integrate but not really considered why one would want to integrate. Integration is often associated with computing areas like we‚Äôve talked about, but it can also find volumes and other physical quantities too.\nIntegration is also important when solving of differential equations - though that‚Äôs a topic beyond the scope of this course. These can be used to model all sorts of real-world phenomena, including population growth, weather, and the motion of planets, so finding solutions is of great practical significance.\n\n\nInitially, we looked at the link between acceleration, velocity and displacement when it came to differentiation. Let‚Äôs look at this again using what we now know about integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis speaks to how integration can link these concepts together."

    "text": "In school, the idea of functions is often introduced early on through the concept of a ‚Äòfunction machine‚Äô. This is some imagined box which takes in some number \\(x\\) as an input, carries out some operation \\(f\\) and then returns another number \\(y\\) as output.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, this would be denoted \\(f:x \\rightarrow y\\) or \\(y = f(x)\\) which would be read as ‚Äú\\(y\\) equals \\(f\\) of \\(x\\)‚Äù or ‚Äúthe function \\(f\\) applied to \\(x\\)‚Äù. As an example of how this might look in practice, the function \\(f(x) = 2x\\) maps values to their double. If \\(x = 7\\) for instance, the output of the function will be \\(f(2) = 14\\).\nFunctions are an important concept in mathematics, and they describe many natural and human-made phenomena. The speed of growth of a plant for instance is a function of (amongst other factors), the temperature of the weather.\n\n\nAside from the relationship between variables, essential to this idea of functions is the set of values that it‚Äôs possible to use as inputs or receive as outputs. This is reflected in the full mathematical definition of a function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nA function is a relationship that maps elements from one set \\(A\\) to another set \\(B\\), where each element in \\(A\\) is uniquely associated with an element in \\(B\\). This may be denoted \\(f:A\\rightarrow{}B\\).\n\n\nHere, the first set of values \\(A\\) is called the domain, and can be thought of as the set of valid inputs for \\(f\\). The second set of values \\(B\\) is called the codomain, and can be thought of as the type of numbers we expect to get out of \\(f\\). Linked to that is the range; this is the subset of all codomain values that are actually received as outputs.\nFor example, consider the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) where \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\). This function takes any real number as an input, and returns another real number as the output; its domain is the reals, and the codomain is the reals. However square numbers are always positive, so the range of \\(f\\) is restricted to the positive real numbers.\nSometimes it is easier to think of where a function is not defined, rather than when it is. For instance, the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers (e.g.¬†\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is not a real number). Similarly, dividing by zero is not meaningful, so \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is not defined for \\(x=0\\).\nIn theory (but not always in practice) a function should always have it‚Äôs domain specified. For example, strictly speaking we should say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\geq 0\\rbrace,\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\ne 0\\rbrace.\\]\n\n\n\nWhile the domain may be restricted because the graph is only defined for certain values, we may also restrict it because in the context of the real-world problem some answers do not make sense. For example, if we wishes to use out function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) to find integer squares we could define its domain as \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), rather than \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nWe are constructing a rabbit enclosure from \\(60 m\\) of fence. With only this fence, we want to make the largest possible rectangular enclosure for our bunny. One side of the enclosure is against the wall so we don‚Äôt need any fence on that side.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraically, we can write that we are aiming to maximize the enclosure‚Äôs area \\(L\\times{}W\\) and that our solution must satisfy \\(L + 2W = 60\\). However, since \\(L\\) and \\(W\\) represent lengths of fence in the real world they must also be positive numbers.\nThis is an example of a domain restriction.

    "text": "A polynomial is a type of function generalised from straight lines and quadratics. In other words, linear functions (straight lines) and quadratic functions are examples of polynomials.\nA polynomial is any function that can be written in the form: \\[\n  f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0\n\\] where \\(x\\) is our variable, each \\(a_i\\) is a coefficient, and \\(n\\) is a strictly positive integer.\nThe degree of the polynomial is \\(n\\), i.e. the highest power of \\(x\\) which appears in the expression. Familiar examples of polynomials include:\n\nlinear, e.g.¬†\\(y= 5x-9\\) which has degree \\(n=1\\) and \\(a_0=-9, a_1=5\\)\nquadratics, e.g.¬†\\(y=x^2+2x-12\\) which has degree \\(n=2\\) and \\(a_0=-12, a_1=2, a_2=1\\)\ncubics, e.g.¬†\\(y= 2x^3+4x+3\\) which has degree \\(n=3\\) and \\(a_0=3, a_1=4, a_2=0, a_3=2\\).\n\nPlay around with this GeoGebra applet to see how changing the power of the polynomial changes the shape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven our linear \\(ax + b = 0\\) has the solution\n\\[\n  x = -\\frac{b}{a}\n\\]\nand the quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) has solutions\n\\[\n  x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},\n\\]\nit‚Äôs natural to ask, what are the solutions to a general cubic \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\)? Well‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cubic equation is not simple, and the situation gets significantly worse when we look at quartics like \\(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractically, nobody is using either of these to solve polynomial equations in the same way they might use the quadratic equation. Instead, for polynomials of degree three or higher we almost exclusively rely on geometric or computational methods to find the solutions.2\n\n\n\nSolve the equation \\(4 x^4 + 4 x^3 - 28 x^2 - 52 x - 24 = 0\\).\n\nTyping solve 4 x^4 + 4 x^3 - 28 x^2 - 52 x - 24 = 0 gives the nice whole number solutions: \\(x=-2, -1, 3\\).\n\n\n\n\nFind the \\(x\\) values of the intersections between \\(y = 0.6x^4+2.3x^3+2.2x^2+2.5\\) and \\(y = 0.1x+3\\).\n\nThis can either be done graphically using a tool such as GeoGebra, or by equating to the \\(y\\) values and typing solve 0.6x^4+2.3x^3+2.2x^2+2.5=0.1x+3 into Wolfram Alpha. It will return the results:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  x_1 &\\approx -2.2322 \\\\\n  x_2 &\\approx -1.31481\\\\\n  x_3 &\\approx -0.69496\\\\\n  x_4 &\\approx  0.40858\n\\end{align*}\\]\nwhich gives the four \\(x\\) coordinates of the intersections between the two graphs.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many different ways of asking the same thing in essence and getting comfortable with these is part of the course.\nAn example we have seen a few times is how ‚Äúfind the solutions of the equation‚Äù and ‚Äúfind the roots of the graph‚Äù are asking the same thing of you. It is important to be observant for variations though, such as ‚Äúfind the points of intersection between these graphs‚Äù, which would require not only to find the \\(x-\\)coordinate of the intersections, but also the \\(y-\\)coordinates.\n\n\n\nFind the points of intersections between \\(y = 0.6x^4+2.3x^3+2.2x^2+2.5\\) and \\(y = 0.1x+3\\).\n\nContinuing from the above, we substitute our \\(x\\) values into \\(y = 0.1x + 3\\) to find the equivalent \\(y\\) values:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  x_1 \\approx -2.23220  \\Rightarrow y_1 &\\approx -2.2322 \\times0.1 + 3 = 2.77678, \\\\\n  x_2 \\approx -1.31481 \\Rightarrow y_2 &\\approx -1.31481\\times0.1 + 3 = 2.868519, \\\\\n  x_3 \\approx -0.69496 \\Rightarrow y_3 &\\approx -0.69496\\times0.1 + 3 = 2.930504, \\\\\n  x_4 \\approx \\phantom{+}0.40858 \\Rightarrow y_4 &\\approx 0.40858\\times0.1 + 3 = 3.040858.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nUsing a technique called interpolation, we can work backwards; given some points, we can find the polynomial that goes through them. We have already seen this for linear equations back in section 4, we just didn‚Äôt call it interpolation at the time.\n\n\n\nWhat is the equation of the quadratic that passes through (-1, 2), (0, 0), and (1, 2)?\n\nWe know that the general equation of a quadratic is \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\). If a quadratic passes through a point, it must then be the case that substituting in the \\(x\\) coordinate of a point will give the \\(y\\) coordinate of the point.\nFor example if it passes through \\((x, y) = (-1, 2)\\) it must be the case that \\[\n  2 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b + c.\n\\]\nWe can similarly substitute with the other points to formulate the situation as a set of simultaneous equations:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  2 &= a - b + c, \\\\\n  0 &= c, \\\\\n  2 &= a + b + c.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSubstituting \\(c = 0\\) into the first and second equations gives a reduced system\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  2 &= a - b, \\\\\n  2 &= a + b.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nRearranging the first equation gives \\(b = a - 2\\), which when substituted into the second equation gives \\(2 = 2a - 2\\). Solving this gives \\(a = 2\\), and so \\(b = a - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0\\) follows.\nThus, the polynomial that passes through those three points is \\(y = 2x^2\\).\n\n\n\n\nFind the equation of the cubic that has this graph:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we could approach this algebraically in the same way as previous, this will lead to a set of four simultaneous equations in four variables. That may take some time to solve.\nAs an alternative approach, we may use Wolfram Alpha through interpolate polynomial through (-2,0), (-1,0), (0,-1) and (3,0). It will return output that looks something like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the polynomial that best interpolates the points (4,5), (-1,2) and (9,3).\n\nIn Wolfram Alpha, type interpolate polynomial through (4,5),(-1,2) and (9,3). It will return the curve \\(y= -\\frac{x^2}{10} + \\frac{9 x}{10} + 3\\)."

    "text": "With these more general ideas of functions under our belt, we can also return to trig functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that given some triangle with highlighted angle \\(\\theta\\), we define the three trig functions as\n\n\\(\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\\).\n\\(\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\\).\n\\(\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{opposite}{adjacent}\\).\n\n\n\nEach of the trig functions have an equivalent inverse trig function.

We have avoided that to emphasise that \\(\\arcsin(x) = \\sin^{-1}(x)\\) is not the same as \\(\\sin(x)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\).3\nGiven two sides in a right-angled triangle, we can use the inverse trigonometric ratios to find the size of the angles.\n\n\n\nFind the size of the angle \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are given the lengths of the opposite and adjacent so we will use the tangent ratio.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\tan(\\alpha) &= \\frac{1.4}{1.9} \\\\\n          \\alpha &= \\arctan\\left( \\frac{14}{19} \\right) \\\\\n                 &= 36.38^{\\circ}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are given the lengths of the opposite and hypotenuse so we will use the sine ratio.\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\sin(\\beta) &= \\frac{4.9}{5.55} \\\\\n        \\beta &= \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{98}{111} \\right) \\\\\n              &= 61.99^{\\circ}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply the same idea about transforming linear equations and quadratics to trig functions too (or any general function for that matter). The graph \\(y=sin(x)\\) is the standard graph of the sine function. The graph of \\(y=2 sin(x)\\) is a similar graph, but it has a greater amplitude, it was stretched vertically by a factor of 2. Instead of just going up to \\(1\\) and down to \\(-1\\), the second graph goes up to \\(2\\) and down to \\(-2\\).\nThe value that sine is multiplied in the previous example is called the amplitude and, as sine graphs can model sound, it is in fact related to the amplitude of a sound (i.e.¬†how loud a sound is).\nPlay around with the sine sound generator at onlinetonegenerator.com. The tool allows you to change the frequency of the graph, which affects the pitch of the sound. In maths, we often talk about the related concepts of period and wavelength. As the frequency of the sound increases, the period decreases, the pitch goes up.\nTo look at how this is modelled, consider the following interactive graph of \\(y=a\\cos(b(x+c))+d\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are parameters.\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see that changing the parameters has the following impact:\n\n\\(a\\) stretches the graph in the vertical direction by a factor of \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\) stretches the graph in the horizontal direction by a factor of \\(\\frac{1}{b}\\),\n\\(c\\) translate the graph horizontally by \\(-c\\) units,\n\\(d\\) translate the graph up by \\(+d\\) units.\n\nAlso note that the change of the parameters of \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), which affect the \\(x\\)-coordinate, are somewhat counter-intuitive.4\nSometimes, the parameters for a transformation applied to sine or cosine can be read directly off the graph. But sometimes, it is not quite as clear and a formula is useful.\n\nTo find \\(a\\), the amplitude of the graph (i.e.¬†the vertical stretch), find half the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the graph: \\(a= \\frac{\\max-\\min}{2}\\).\nTo find \\(d\\), the vertical shift, find the average between the maximum and the minimum value: \\(d = \\frac{\\max+\\min}{2}\\).\nTo find \\(b\\), the horizontal stretch, find the period and divide either \\(360^{\\circ}\\) or \\(2\\pi\\) (depending what units you are working in) by its value; \\(b = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{\\text{period}}\\) or \\(b=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\text{period}}\\).\nFinding \\(c\\), the vertical translation, is the trickiest. It relies on comparing important points on the graph with the standard sine or cosine graphs. Find the difference between the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the maximum of the standard graph and that of the given graph and from that figure out whether the graph was shifted right (negative \\(c\\) value) or left (positive \\(c\\) value).\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the equation of a sine graph with amplitude \\(5\\) and period length \\(200\\)?\n\nThe \\(5\\) is the vertical stretch so \\(a = 5\\), and the \\(200\\) is the horizontal stretch by a factor of $ $. Thus \\(b= \\frac{2\\pi}{200} = \\frac{\\pi}{100}\\), and the equation for this graph is \\(f(x)=5\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{100}\\right)\\).\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the equation of a cosine graph with a maximum at $ (,9)$, a minimum at $ (,5) $, and normal period length \\(2\\pi\\)?\n\nFrom this information it follows that \\(a = \\frac{\\max-\\min}{2} = \\frac{9-5}{2} = 2\\) and \\(d = \\frac{9+5}{2}=7\\). The sideways shift of the standard maximum of \\((0,1)\\) to \\((\\frac{\\pi}{6},9)\\) implies that the value of \\(c\\) is negative and the difference between \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) and \\(0\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\), so the horizontal shift is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\).\nPutting this together, the equation would be\n\\[\n  f(x) = 7 + 2\\cos\\left(x-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use trig functions to model real-life patterns, such as the amount of daylight in Aberdeen for instance, we need to be able to scale and translate the graphs using transformations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed above, we can think about this algebraically or geometrically.\n\n\nOn the longest day of the year, there are about \\(17.5\\) hours of daylight and on the shortest day of the year, \\(4.5\\) hours of daylight. On average, therefore, there are \\(12.25\\) hours of sunlight per day. That is our value of \\(d\\).\nThe amplitude is given by the difference between the average \\(d\\) and the maximum \\(17.5 - 12.15 = 5.25\\) hours.\nThe period is the number of days in a year, which is about \\(365.2425\\) days. The value of \\(b\\) therefore is \\(b = \\frac{2\\pi}{365.2425} \\approx 0.0172\\) (3 s.f.).\nThe last consideration is that the cosine graph starts on its maximum value but the day of longest day light is on the 21st of June, which is day \\(193\\). Therefore, \\(c=193\\).\nTherefore, the amount of daylight in Aberdeen can be modelled by the function\n\\[\n   f(x) = 5.25\\cos(0.0086(x-193)) + 12.25.\n\\]\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let us take a moment to familiarise ourselves with the information the graph contains. On the horizontal axis, we have the months of the year starting with January of the year 2010. On the vertical axis, you have the time of day measured in hours from midnight. The two lower lines represent the sunrise and the upper two represent the sunset. It is the red line we are interested in, as this is the time in BST (British Summer Time).\nLet us consider only the red line representing the sun rise in Aberdeen throughout 2010. You might then start to compare it with the periodic functions we learned about so far. The cosine graph is the most similar as it starts at it‚Äôs extreme value. The length of the period of the graph that would model the sunrise however should be one year not \\(2\\pi\\). So the graph needs to be scaled in the horizontal direction.\nFrom there, we see that the amplitude of the graph is not \\(1\\) so we need to be able to scale it in the vertical direction also. A cosine graph rises and dips below the \\(x-\\)axis which means that it averages out to \\(zero\\). Here however, the average sunrise time seems to be closer to \\(7\\text{am}\\).\nNow try to adjust the parameters so that the graph models the green/red line when the sun rises in Aberdeen.\n\n\n\n\nWhen modelling real-life data, there are not only inaccuracies but there are also assumptions and concessions that need to be made. Here for example, daylight savings creates a jump which means there‚Äôs inaccuracy in using a simple cosine graph to model the sunrise in Aberdeen.5\n\n\n\n\nThere are algebraic methods for solving equations that involve trig functions, but such problems are typically outwith arts, humanities, and social sciences. If you do encounter such a problem though, be aware that their solutions have some distinct properties compared to polynomials for example.\n\n\n\nSolve the equation \\(\\sin(x) = \\cos(x)\\) for \\(0\\leq x \\leq 2\\pi\\).\n\nThe first point to highlight is that, without the domain restriction, there will be an infinite number of solutions! To see why, consider the geometric interpretation of the question as finding the \\(x\\) coordinates where the graphs \\(y = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(y = \\cos(x)\\) intersect. Like the periodic functions themselves, the number of intersections also repeat at regular intervals.\nGeometrically, in with domain \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\pi\\) we can see that there are two solutions: \\(x=0.79\\) and \\(x=3.39\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Wolfram Alpha with solve sin(x) = cos(x) for 0 &lt; x &lt; 2pi, we receive the following output which gives the exact values as \\(x=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) and \\(x = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\)."

    "text": "We have talked about how exponentials can model growth, but in our day to day we don‚Äôt always encounter growth in this continuous way as a curve. Rather, we encounter it in a discrete way as a sequence.\n\n\nSay I set myself a New Years resolution of reading more. At the moment I read about 3 pages per night, but I have the idea to increase this by two pages every day in January. On the January 1st I‚Äôll read 5 pages, on Jan 2nd read 7 pages, on Jan 3rd read 9 pages, and so on.\nThe number of pages I will is a sequence: [ 5, 7, 9, . ] The (n^{}) term in a sequence is denoted (a_n), so here (a_1 = 5), (a_2 = 7), etc. By observation we might be able to see that on the (n^{}) day I will have read (3+2n) pages, so here (a_n = 3+2n).\nThis means that we can work out a given term in the sequence without calculating all the intermediate terms. For example, on January 31st I‚Äôll read (a_{31} = 3 + 2 = 65) pages.\nIn general, We define the (n^{}) term of an arithmetic sequence as (a_n = a_0 + nd), where (a_0) is our starting value and (d) is the difference we move by each term. So in the previous example, (a_0 = 3) and (d = 2).\nSuppose now I want to find how many pages (S) I will read in January total. This would be the [ S = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{31}. ] We could compute this by hand, but there exists a handy formula [ S_n = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{n} = . ] This sum is called an arithmetic series and you may also see this sum denoted using ‚Äòsigma‚Äô notation [ S_n = {m=1}^{n} a_m = . ] For my reading goal, that means [ S{31} = _{n=1}^{31}(3+2n) = = = 1085. ] That‚Äôs almost the same number of pages as War and Peace, so probably not realistic as resolutions go!\n\n\n\nAnother context where growth comes up is in savings or interest. Say I put (50) in a savings account with 2% annual interest. That is, at the end of the year 2% of the total balance is added extra by the bank.\nAt the end of the first year, it will contain (50 + 2%50 = 50 + 1 = 51). Next year though, (2%) of my balance isn‚Äôt (1) any more, it‚Äôs (2%51 = 1.02).\nBy remembering that increasing by (2%) is the same as multiply by (1 + = 1.02), we can put To put it back in the language of sequences as \\[\\begin{align*}\n  a_0 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\\\\n  a_1 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_2 &= (\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_3 &= ((\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] or, simplifying using powers, (a_n = ^n). That means in thirty five years my savings pot will be a whole [ a_{35} = 50^{35} = 99.99448. ] Well, (99.99) isn‚Äôt nothing, but it‚Äôs certainly not a retirement fund.\nIn general, We define the (n^{}) term of an geometric sequence as (a_n = a_0 r^n), where (a_0) is our starting value and (r) is the common ratio we increase by each term. So in the previous example, (a_0 = 50) and (r = 1.02). Similar to before, we can compute the sum of these terms - the geometric series - as [ S_n = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{n} = . ] This formula doesn‚Äôt hold when (r = 1) since it would require dividing by zero, though in that case the value of (S_n) can be worked out directly from its definition."

    "text": "Probability and statistics are closely related. When we analyse data, we need to ask: is this data due to chance alone or is there some underlying pattern? Probability is the study of chance. Probability assigns a number between (0) and (1) to how likely an event is to happen. A probability of (0) means that the event is impossible; a probability of (1) means the event is certain to happen. The higher the probability, the more likely the event is to happen. A probability of (0.5) means that an event is just as likely to happen as it is to not happen (‚Äú50/50 chance‚Äù, ‚Äúeven chance‚Äù).\n\n\n\n\nThe ‚Äúprobability of event (A)‚Äù is usually expressed as (P(A)). The probability of landing on Heads if you toss a coin could therefore be expressed as (P(H)) where (H) stands for the number of heads.\n\nThe values for probability lie between 0 and 1. They can be expressed as\n\n\na fraction, for instance (),\n\n\na decimal number, for instance 0.5,\n\n\na percentage, for instance 50%,\n\n\na chance, for instance: 1 in 2 chance,\n\n\na ratio: 1:1.\n\n\nThese equivalent expressions are often used interchangeably and can be used for any probability we wish to represent. For example, consider the event of throwing a five on a fair die. The probability of this is( ) which we can express this as:\n\n\na fraction: ( ),\n\n\na decimal number: 0.167 (rounded to three significant figures),\n\n\na percentage: approximately 16.7% (rounded to three significant figures),\n\n\na chance: a 1 in 6 chance or\n\n\na ratio: 1:5 (out of 6 outcomes we expect for 1 successful outcome and 5 unsuccessful outcomes).\n\n\nIn this course, we usually express probabilities either as an exact value, usually in fraction form, or as a decimal number, rounded either using significant figures or decimal places.\n\nTo calculate the theoretical probability of an event, we need to know the sample space of an experiment.\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for when we roll a die (dice) is the set of the six possible outcomes {1,2,3,4,5,6}. In this case, all these outcomes are equally likely.\n\n\nWhen each outcome of an experiment is equally likely, the probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes contained within the event by the total number of outcomes of the experiment.\n\nWork out the probability of:\n\n\n\nrolling a 4 and\n\n\n\nwork out the probability of rolling a number larger than 3.\n\n\n\n\nSolution to a)\nThere are 4 outcomes in the sample space {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The event we wish to find is rolling a four, which is just one of six possible outcomes. So the probability of rolling a six, is 1 divided by 6, or ( ). Solution to b)\nTo find the probability of rolling a number larger than 3 consider the number of outcomes that ‚Äúsatisfy‚Äù this requirement. The three outcomes are: rolling a (4), rolling a (5) or rolling a (6). There are still (6) possible outcomes in total and the probability of each is (), so the probability of rolling a number larger than (3) is given by (), which equals ( ).\n\nNow imagine rolling two dice and considering what the possible outcomes are. You could roll a 2 and a 5, or a 5 and a 2. Or two times a 5. You can picture the sample space as a table:\n\n\n\nNote that the outcomes (2,3) and (3,2) are not the same. We will come back to this example.\n\nSome probabilities like the ones we just looked at can be understood logically, using theory. In other cases, we cannot figure out the probability of an event using logic alone. For example, if we wanted to know the probability that a woman from a particular population will be between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, we need to collect data, i.e.¬†measure the heights of a large number of women in that population to see how many are between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, and use this to estimate the probability for the whole population. We call such a probability an experimental probability.\nSometimes, instead of an actual experiment, we can use computer simulations.\nNot to put you off but here is Sir David Spiegelhalter‚Äôs take on the understanding of probability:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuSqWRuz-mU"

Define \\(B\\) as the prime numbers between 0 and 15: {2,3,5,7,11,13}. The union of these two sets is \\(A\\cup B\\) = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}.

The difference between the objects on the table and those I need to take with me is {wallet} - I wonder where I left it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place sets come up most frequently is in Venn diagrams.\n\n\n\nxkcd.com/773/\n\n\nA Venn diagram is a diagram style that shows the relation between sets, and was invented by English mathematician and logician John Venn in the 1880s. As the diagrams can be used to represent sets we can use them to represent probabilities for combinations of different events. The circles each represent one set. There can be any number of sets[^Though if we want circles, that limits us to three! Beyond that we have to introduce ellipses, sausages, and other squiggly constructs.]. The rectangle around them is the universal set, denoted \\(\\mathfrak{U}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA survey was done on first year students on what they felt made them like some animals more than others. \\(42\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that was fluffy, while \\(28\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that had big teeth. \\(4\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal with both of these characteristics.\nWe can use these data to estimate the probability that a student will favour an animal that is fluffy OR has big teeth, or is fluffy AND has big teeth. Below we see a Venn diagram of the probabilities that a student‚Äôs favourite animal will be fluffy, have big teeth, or be fluffy and have big teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this diagram you can see for instance that although \\(28\\%\\) of students seem to prefer animals with big teeth, \\(24\\%\\) students preferred them to have big teeth but NOT be fluffy.\n\n\nWith this squared away, we can return to probability proper and better understand some of its more complicated concepts."

    "text": "Visualisation can be very helpful in understanding probability. We‚Äôve already looked at Venn diagrams so now we‚Äôll turn to trees.\n\n\n\nExample of a tree diagram\n\n\nTree diagrams, also known as probability trees, are particularly useful when there are several events (not necessarily sequential). They are very useful when investigating dependent probabilities.\nNodes (black circles above) represent outcomes or series of outcomes, while edges (the lines between them) represent steps that move from one outcome to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose we a bag containing five counters, of which two are blue and three are red. We randomly choose two counters from the bag, one after the other without replacing the first one in the bag. The possible outcomes are:\n\nchoosing either two red counters,\ntwo blue counters, or\none of each.\n\nIn order to calculate these probabilities it is useful to draw a probability tree. In this, we should consider the possible outcomes of drawing the first counter; and then the outcomes of drawing the second counter (given the counter we picked in our first draw) and the associated probabilities of these different events. ‚ÄòEvent one‚Äô is drawing the first counter and ‚Äòevent two‚Äô is drawing the second counter.\nFor this example we obtain the following probability tree, where the circle on the far left-hand side represents the initial state of the experiment; three red counters and two blue counters in the bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two branches of the tree leaving the initial circle represent the two outcomes of the first part of our experiment, where we pick one counter out of the bag. The event ‚Äòpicking a blue counter‚Äô is represented by the top branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), is shown next to the branch (there are two blue counters out of a total of five counters). The event ‚Äòpicking a red counter‚Äô is represented by the lower branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), is shown next to this branch. Both branches lead to new circles, which represent the state of the experiment after one counter is drawn from the bag at random.\nEach of the two new states have two branches emerging from them. Each branch represents the outcome of having picked either a blue or a red counter on the second turn, and the probability of each outcome is shown next to the branch. The four circles on the far right-hand side of the tree represent the final states of the experiment.\nUsually a probability tree is simplified, without such explicit drawings of the practical situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach path through the tree represents a unique outcome of the experiment. Each path corresponds to independent events. Hence, the probability of each outcome along a given path is calculated by multiplying together the probabilities on each branch of the given path.\nFor instance, the probability of picking two blue counters is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(BB) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]\nThese events (paths) are mutually exclusive, and so the probability of one or the other happening is found by adding the probabilities corresponding to the individual paths. For instance, the probability of picking a red counter on the second go is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{red on 2nd go}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} =\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]"

    "text": "Watch this short video (4:31min) from TED- Ed. Be ready to pause the video to solve the riddle when the video asks you to.\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cpwSGsb-rTs\nWe will come back to this example in a moment. But first, definitions and vocabulary: A conditional probability is the probability that an event occurs, given that some other event has occurred. For example, it is known that people who smoke are more likely to get lung cancer than those who do not. The probability that an arbitrary person will get lung cancer is quite low, but the probability that a person will get lung cancer, given that they smoke, is much higher. Given an event \\(A\\) and an event \\(B\\), we write the probability that \\(A\\) occurs, given that \\(B\\) has already happened, as \\(P(A | B)\\). In the above example, we might write \\(A\\) for the event that a person gets lung cancer, and \\(B\\) for the event that that person smokes. Then the probability of a person getting lung cancer, given that they smoke, is \\(P(A | B)\\). For our Frog Riddle example, event \\(A\\) is the croak, event \\(B\\) is that you get the anti-dote to the poison in the mushroom (i.e.¬†you find a female frog). If you walk right, the probability that you find a female frog is \\(50\\%\\). If you walk left, the probability is \\(P(B | A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nConditional probability is important when looking at probabilities of multiple events that are dependent. In the above example, the events \\(A\\) (a person gets lung cancer) and \\(B\\) (a person smokes) are dependent on one another, because whether or not someone smokes affects the probability that they get lung cancer.\nWe can use conditional probabilities to test whether or not two events are dependent: Two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent only if \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\), and \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). The probability that someone gets lung cancer given that they smoke is greater than the general probability that they will get lung cancer, and so \\(P(A|B)\\) is not equal to \\(P(A)\\). Therefore, events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are dependent on one another. For our Frog riddle example, the two events \\(A\\) ‚Äúcroak‚Äù and \\(B\\) ‚Äúone of the two frogs in female‚Äù are clearly not independent because the croak tells us that least one of the two frogs is male. The probability that if you have two frogs at least one of them is female is \\(P(B)=\\frac{3}{4} =0.75\\), but given the croak, \\(P(B|A)=\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 67\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nSuppose a bag contains \\(10\\) balls, \\(6\\) red and \\(4\\) blue. Two balls are chosen (without replacement) at random, one after the other. Consider the two events \\(R,\\ B\\):\n\n\\(R\\) is event ‚Äúfirst ball chosen is red‚Äô‚Äô \\(B\\) is event‚Äùsecond ball chosen is blue‚Äô‚Äô\n\nShow that the probability of picking a blue ball second is different to picking a blue ball second given that the first chosen ball was red. Solution Perhaps the easiest way of thinking about and calculating with conditional probabilities is to use a tree diagram. In fact, we have met some conditional probabilities in disguise when we examined tree diagrams in the previous section. Creating a tree diagram for the above situation gives the following:\n\n Rewriting the branches of this diagram with our above conditional probability notation then gives:\n\n Thus, we can read off the probability of picking a blue ball second given the first ball was red by looking at the second from top branch of the diagram. Thus, \\[ P(B|R) = \\frac{4}{9}.\\] We can work out the probability of picking a blue ball second by adding up the probability of each branch involving picking a blue ball second, that is \\[ P(B) = P(B|R) + P(B|R')= \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}.\\]\n\n\n\nGiven two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) then the conditional probability \\(\\text{P}(B|A)\\) is given by: \\[ P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} \\qquad \\text{or, equivalently} \\qquad P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A).\\]\n\n\nThe top shelf has 3 cans of chicken noodle soup and 2 cans of tomato soup. The bottom shelf contains 4 cans of tomoto soup and 1 can of chicken noodle soup. Because it is easier, we are twice as likely to take a can from the bottom shelf (\\(P(bottom)=\\frac{2}{3}\\)) as we are from the top shelf (\\(P(top)=\\frac{1}{3}\\)).\n\n\nSuppose we take a can of soup without paying attention to which one it is, what isa) the probability that is chicken noodle? b) the probability that the can was taken from the top shelf, given that it is chicken noodle soup? Solution\nLet event \\(T\\): the can was taken from the top shelf. \\(C\\): the chosen soup is chicken noodle soup. The probability that the soup is a chicken noodle soup is \\(P(C)\\). It can be chosen from the top or bottom shelf so \\[P(C) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} +\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5}  = \\frac{5}{15}\\] The probability that it was taken from the top shelf, given that it is chicken noodle soup is \\(P(T|C)\\). Using the formula $ P(T | C) = $ we realise that we have \\(P(C)\\) but not yet the probability that the soup was chosen form the top shelf AND was chicken noodle \\(P(T \\cap C)\\). \\[P(C \\cap T) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5}\n= \\frac{3}{15}\\]. Using the above formula for conditional probability \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{P(T \\cap C)}{P(C)} \\] we therefore have \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{15}}{\\frac{5}{15}} = \\frac35\\] So the probability that the mushroom soup came from the top shelf is \\(0.6\\). Note that the order is important. If we asked, what is the probability that it is chicken noodle soup, given that the can came from the top shelf, the answer would be \\[ P(C | T) = \\frac{P(T \\cap C)}{P(T)} \\] we therefore have \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{15}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{9}{15}=\\frac35\\] which makes sense given that there are three chicken noodle soups out of five on the top shelf."

    "text": "There are combinations and permutations. They are quite similar with one important difference.\nNote that we will not deal with case where repetitions are allowed in this course.\n\nThe mathematical function that helps us count how many times a success occurs in a given number of trials is combinations. This is often written as (nCr) or (). This ‚Äún choose r‚Äù can be calculated using the Excel command =COMBIN(n,r). Combinations arise from the simple question: In how many different ways can I select (r) objects out of (n) objects? For instance, if you have seven people, and you want to select two out of these seven, then there are ({7}C{2} = 21) different ways. You can understand this in a visual way also. In each column there are seven squares, two of which are coloured in.\nThis can be done in 21 different ways.\n\n\n\nLet the experiment be that we toss three coins. Let ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù be that any one coin lands on Heads. So each experiment is three Bernoulli trials with (p=). We are interested to know how many of the possible outcomes have two heads. We could make a tree diagram:\n\n You can see from the tree diagram, that out of the eight possible outcomes, three of them contain exactly two heads. But since, if we were to consider more than just three coins, a tree diagram and counting outcomes would become unmanageable, we use the combination function. We need ‚Äú3 choose 2‚Äù, i.e.¬†({3}C{2} = ). In Excel the function is =COMBIN(3,2) = 3.\n\nThere are 6 possible topics that an examiner could chose from. If they need to choose four out of those 6, then we need (_6C_4 = ) = COMBIN(6,4)= 15. So there are 15 different ways that the examiner could chose four topics out of six. You can picture it like this too: ABCDEC. Choose four letters from these six. Here is the list of the fifteen possible choices:\n\n\n\n\n\nABCD\n\n\nABCE\n\n\nABCF\n\n\nABDE\n\n\nABDF\n\n\nABEF\n\n\nACDE\n\n\nACDF\n\n\nACEF\n\n\nADEF\n\n\nBCDE\n\n\nBCDF\n\n\nBCEF\n\n\nBDEF\n\n\nCDEF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe School of Mathematics has 60 lecturers, and needs to choose 3 of them to teach Introduction to Linear Algebra. How many different lecturing teams are possible? Since we have 60 people to choose from and want to select 3, (n=60) and (r=3). using Excel, we type =COMBIN(60,3) and obtain ({60}C{3} = ) = 34220.\n\nThe difference between permutations and combinations is that sometimes, you care about the order that something is chosen.\nFor instance, if you wanted to choose two colours out of three colours to chose from, Red, Blue, Green.\nIf you didn‚Äôt care about the order, then there are three ways of choosing the colours:\n\nRed/Blue, Red/Green and Blue/Green.\n\nIf however, you care about the order, that would mean that you have six ways of choosing colours:\n\nRed/Blue, Blue/Red, Red/Green, Green/Red, Blue/Green and Green/Red.\n\nPermutations are ‚Äúordered combinations‚Äù.\nImagine a very simple combination lock with only the numbers (1,2,3,4). The combination lock opens when you have the correct three numbers, in the correct order. Therefore, you do not need combinations (despite us calling it a ‚Äúcombination lock‚Äù), you need permutations!\nSo you have four numbers and need to choose three from these, while caring about the order:\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n\n124\n\n\n132\n\n\n134\n\n\n142\n\n\n143\n\n\n\n\n213\n\n\n214\n\n\n231\n\n\n234\n\n\n241\n\n\n243\n\n\n\n\n312\n\n\n314\n\n\n321\n\n\n324\n\n\n341\n\n\n342\n\n\n\n\n412\n\n\n413\n\n\n421\n\n\n423\n\n\n431\n\n\n432\n\n\n\n\n\n=permut(4,3)(=24). Whereas, there would only have been the following had we not cared about the order - i.e.¬†the combination of three numbers:\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n\n124\n\n\n134\n\n\n234\n\n\n\n\n\n=COMBIN(4,2)=(4).\n\nWhen you choose (r) objects from (n) to chose from (be they people, objects or even choices), then you will have\n\n\n=combin(n,r) to choose from if you do not care about order and do not allow repetition.\n\n\n=permut(n,r) to choose from if you care about the order and do not allow repetition.\n\n\nThe mathematical formulae, which you do not need to know for this course but which some of you might be familiar with are:\n\n\n=combin(n,r) (=) to choose from if you do not care about order and do not allow repetition.\n\n\n=permut(n,r) (=) to choose from if you care about the order and do not allow repetition.\n\n\n\n\nSample variation is the result of independent trials with unchanging probability where fluctuations are due to many small factors. These fluctuations can be modelled by the normal distribution. This is the essence of the powerful Central Limit Theorem.\n\n\nFor any population, even one not normally distributed, the sample mean (_n) is approximately normally distributed for sufficiently large (n), with (_n N(, ) ).This is called the sampling distribution. (_n) is an unbiased estimator for the population mean ().\n\nIn order for the Central Limit Theorem to hold, the sample size is typically considered sufficiently large when (np ) and (n(1-p) ), which is called the success-failure condition.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we want to estimate the mean weight of new-born babies. We could take a sample of 20 new-borns, find their mean weight, and use this to estimate the mean weight of all new-born baby. Here, our population parameter is the mean weight of all new-born babies, while the sample parameter is the mean weight of the new-borns in the sample of 20. If we were to repeat the sampling, i.e.¬†take more samples of 20 new-borns, then the sampling distribution is the normal distribution of the mean weight of all possible samples of 20 new-borns.\n\n\nSuppose that we wish to estimate the probability of rolling a 3 on a die which we suspect to be unfair. We could collect data by rolling the die 100 times and recording whether or not it rolled a 3 each time. Here, our population parameter is the probability of rolling a 3, while the sample parameter is the proportion of times that a 3 is rolled from 100 rolls. The sampling distribution is the normal distribution of the proportion of 3s of all samples of size 100.\n\n\n\n\nLet a random variable (X) have a mean (60) and standard deviation (4). A sample of size (45) is taken from (X). Find the probability that the mean of the sample is less than (59).\n\nSince the sample size is large enough, (n = 45 &gt; 30), we can apply the Central Limit Theorem. [ n N(, ) ] translates to: [ {45} N(60, ) ]\nThis means that (_{45}) is approximately normally distributed with mean (60) and standard deviation (). Therefore we can calculate the probability using the =NORM.DIST function in Excel:=NORM.DIST(59,60,4/SQRT(45),TRUE) = 0.0468 (3sf). The probability that the mean of a sample is less than 59 is approximately 4.7%.\n\n\n\nThe content of a certain type of soft drink cans is, on average 328 mL. The content is normally distributed with this mean of 328 mL and a standard deviation of 7.2 mL. Find the probability that:\n\n\nan individual soft drink can contains less than 325 mL.\n\n\na box of 36 cans has average contents less than 325 mL per can.\n\n\n\n\nThe random variable is the content of an individual soft drink can. It is normally distributed with mean 328 mL and standard deviation 7.2 mL. Therefore, using =NORM.DIST(325,328,7.2,TRUE) you get (P(X&lt;325) = 0.338 ) (3sf)\nThe average contents ({36}) of a box of (36) cans is normally distributed with the same mean average (328) mL and with the standard deviation (). Therefore, using =NORM.DIST(325,328,7.2/6,TRUE) you get (P({36} &lt; 325) = 0.00621) (3sf). This means that the probability that a box of 36 cans has an average content of less than 325 ml per can is 0.62% (2sf)."

    "text": "We have studied the normal distribution curve. As mentioned, it was found when errors in measurement were investigated.\nIn summary, when we take a sample of a population, the difference between its mean and that of the population can be considered an ‚Äúerror in measurement‚Äù. It is unlikely to be exactly the same mean as that of the population, but it‚Äôs unlikely to be totally different from it.\n\n\n\nConsider the situation in which a pharmaceutical company wants to test whether a new medicine is effective treatment for a particular disease. (Note that in real life, these tests are a lot more complicated than we describe here but the fundamental ideas are the same.) Let us say that it is known from prior data that 48% of patients with this disease will improve without treatment. Suppose the medicine is now tested on 100 patients improve. Since 60% is an increase of 12% over the percentage of patients who will improve without treatment, can we conclude that the drug increases the improvement rate by 12%? How certain is this result? As we are only taking a sample we need to account for sampling variability when making statements about whether or not the drug improves the condition of the patient. In other words we want to test whether the drug has\n\n\nno effect on the number of patients or\n\n\nthe drug increases the number of patients who improve.\n\n\n\nFarmer Janet grows tomatoes. Last year, she weighed a sample of 50 tomatoes and found that the mean weight was 105.3g with standard deviation 12g. This year, she used a new fertilizer to try to increase the weight of her tomatoes. She took a random sample of 65 tomatoes and found that the mean weight of the sample was 110.6g with standard deviation 13.9g. Can she conclude that the fertilizer increased the weight of her tomatoes?\n\n\n\n\nThink of a hypothesis test like a legal trial where the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty.\n\n\nYou start with the assumption that the defendant is innocent. That is what we call the ‚Äúnull hypothesis‚Äù.\n\n\nDecide how strong the evidence has to be in order to overturn the idea of innocence. This is what we call the ‚Äúsignificance level‚Äù.\n\n\nEvidence is collected and evaluated against the assumption of innocence.\n\n\nIf that evidence goes against the assumption that the defendant is innocent, then the assumption has to be rejected as false. If the evidence does not sufficiently demonstrate that the assumption of innocence can be rejected, then the initial assumption holds.\n\n\nFor the statistical testing the steps are:\n\n\nFormulate the statistical hypotheses, the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\n\nChoose a significance level for the test. This is a threshold for making a decision, like the confidence levels we saw previously.\n\n\nUse data from a sample to calculate a test statistic.\n\n\nCalculate a p-value for the test statistic. This is the probability of that test statistic occurring under the assumptions of one of the hypotheses.\n\n\nMake decisions about the hypotheses.\n\n\nInterpret the decision in the context of the problem.\n\n\nNote that we would never accept the null hypothesis. If our data is deemed to be consistent with the null hypothesis, then we do not have evidence against the null hypothesis, but this does not mean that we have evidence for it: In a courtroom, failing to find the defendant guilty does not prove that the defendant is innocent, it only proves that there is not enough evidence to find them guilty (the verdict is ‚Äònot guilty‚Äô, rather than ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô).\n\n\n\nThis part of the course - hypothesis testing - is the A for ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù in the data cycle (PPDAC). A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon.\nA statistical hypothesis is a statement about a statistical parameter of some population that we are interested in. In the first example above, the hypothesis would be:\n\n\nno effect on the number of patients or\n\n\nthe drug increases the number of patients who improve.\n\n\nbut the statistical hypothesis has to use a statistical parameter. We will see how to do this next.\n\n\n\nIn order to do formulate a statistical hypothesis, we choose a summary statistics of the population that we want to test for. This is called the test statistic. In this course, we always choose the mean. If the observed mean is within the interval of the most unlikely values that we would see if the null hypothesis is true (red area below), then this is evidence against the null hypothesis, and so we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.  If the mean is not within the most likely values (i.e.¬†it is within the most likely values, the blue area) we do not reject the null hypothesis. As an example, say that we want to perform a quality control check on the mean weight of haggis manufactured by a company. We want to test if the mean weight of the haggis is 300g, as stated on the packet. The null hypothesis would be that the mean weight of a haggis is 300g, and our alternative hypothesis that the mean weight of a haggis is not 300g. We take a sample of 100 haggis and weigh them. The observed test statistic is 302g. If, under the assumption that the true mean weight of a haggis is 300g, this observed test statistic lies within the set of ‚Äúmost unlikely‚Äù such test statistic values, then this is evidence against the hypothesis that the mean weight is 300g, and we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\n\nAny statistical hypothesis test begins with the statement of two hypotheses: A null hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis, (H_0) is a statement about the parameter of interest corresponding to the ‚Äòdefault position‚Äô - the current belief about the parameter - that we test against. For example, suppose that we are interested in testing whether a coin is fair. Our default position is that the coin is fair, and so the null hypothesis would be that the probability of flipping a head is (). In a hypothesis test, we test the null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis (H_1), which is the alternative to the null hypothesis and suggests that ‚Äúsomething else is going on‚Äù. For example, in the above example, where we wish to test whether or not a coin is fair, the alternative hypothesis would be that the coin is not fair, in other words, that the probability of flipping a head is not equal to (). The null and alternative hypotheses are usually stated together like this:\n\n\n(H_o): The probability of the coin landing on a head is (0.5).\n\n\n(H_1): The probability of the coin landing on a head is not equal to (0.5).\n\n\n\n\n\nA hypothesis test can be either one-tailed or two-tailed. A hypothesis test is one-tailed if the alternative hypothesis states that the population parameter is either greater than or less than some value. The hypothesis test is two-tailed if the alternative hypothesis states that the population parameter is not equal to a particular value. Given the null hypothesis (H_o = _o), the alternative hypothesis could be: (H_1&gt; _o) one-tailed hypothesis (H_1&lt; _o) one-tailed hypothesis (H_1_o) two-tailed hypothesis  as ( _o) could mean ( &lt; _o) or ( &gt; _o) In the previous example in which we were checking the mean score of an exam, it was a two-tailed hypothesis test, because the alternative hypothesis specified that the mean score was not equal to 60%. Farmer Janet hoping that her tomatoes will be heavier due to the use of fertilizer is a one-tailed hypothesis test because the alternative hypothesis specifies that the new weight is larger than the previous year‚Äôs tomatoes. In general, the question we want to answer will determine which type of alternative hypothesis we choose. Deciding which test to conduct is often down to which the analyst or statistician deems most appropriate for the given question being answered. For example, if the haggis company is only interested in whether they are putting too much haggis in each packet (they are not interested nor want to know if they are putting too little haggis in each packet) they may wish to conduct a one-sided test. Alternatively if they are concerned about whether the information on the packet is accurate (or whether their packing machine is correctly allocating haggis to the packets) they may wish to consider a two-sided test. If conducting a two-sided test they can still conclude whether or not too little or too much is being allocated if the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis (we discuss this below).\n\n\n\nExactly what we mean by ‚Äòmost unlikely‚Äô is determined by the significance level of the hypothesis test, which is a percentage that is always specified before performing such a test. A 5% significance level means that we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis if our observed test statistic is within the 5% most unlikely possible test statistics if the null hypothesis is true. Similarly, a 1% significance level means that we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis if our observed test statistic is within the 1% most unlikely possible test statistics if the null hypothesis is true. The significance level of a hypothesis test could be any percentage, but it is most often between 1% and 10%, and 5% is a very commonly used.\n\n\n\nLet us return to the example of the City of Edinburgh Council investigating the speed at which cars drive past a certain point. The council have reason to believe that the mean speed of cars passing the point is greater than the 30 miles per hour speed limit, and would like to test whether or not this is the case.\n\n\nDefine the problem: Are cars on average going past the point going faster than the speed limit? This means that your test statistic is mean speed of cars\n\n\nDefine what level of certainty you need for your conclusion.\n\n\nDefine the hypotheses:\n\n\n\n(H_o ) the mean speed of the cars passing the point is 30 miles per hour and\n\n\n(H_1 ) mean speed of cars passing the points is greater than 30 miles per hour.\n\n\n\nCollect data on the speeds of 50 cars passing the point, and calculate the mean of their speeds.\n\n\nDetermine whether or not the mean speed of the sampled cars is high enough to be inconsistent with the assumption that the mean speed is 30 miles per hour.\n\n\nIf it is, then reject the null hypothesis. If it is not, then do not reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\nDraw a conclusion for the problem stated initially - are the cars on average driving faster than the speed limit?"

    "text": "The Z-test is the simplest hypothesis test and rarely used. But it is a good introduction to hypothesis testing. It can be used to test hypotheses about a population mean () where:\n\n\nthe population is normally distributed\n\n\nthe population standard deviation () or variance (^2) is known.\n\n\nRemember that if the data of a population is normally distributed with mean () and standard deviation (), then the sample mean ( _n ) is also normally distributed where ( _n ) () (N(, ) ). () is called the standard error. The Z-test can also be used when the population is not normally distributed but the sample size is sufficiently large because of the Central Limit Theorem so that it can be assumed that (_n) is normally distributed). The null hypothesis will be:\n\n\n(H_o): (= _o ) for a normally distributed population with known standard deviation ().\n\n\nLet the significance level be called ().\n\nThe p-value of a test statistic is the probability of the test statistic or a value smaller/larger/different from it being observed if (H_o) is true. There are three cases:\n\n\nleft one tailed ( p = P(X x_0) )\n\n\ntwo tailed ( p = P(X x_0) + P (X x_0) )\n\n\nright one tailed ( p = P(X x_0) = 1 - P(X x_0) )\n\n\n\n\n\nIf (H_1) is a left one-tailed alternative hypothesis, we use one tail of the normal distribution to calculate the p-value.\n\n\nIf (H_1) is a two-tailed alternative hypothesis, i.e.¬†(H_1: _o ), we use both tails of the distribution to calculate the p-value.\np-value = (2 P(X x) ) when x is greater than the mean or (2 P(X x) ) if x is less than the mean.\n\n\nIf (H_1) is a right one-tailed alternative hypothesis, we use one tail of the normal distribution.\n\n\nIn Excel we use the formulae:\n\n\n(p= P (X x_0) ) =NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_err,TRUE).\n\n\n(p= P (X x_0) + P(X x_0 ) ) =2 x NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_dev,TRUE).\n\n\n(p= P (X x_0) = 1 - P(X x_0) )=1-NORM.DIST(x,mean,standard_err,TRUE).\n\nThe significance level () sets the certainty of our conclusion. If the statistic measured in the sample falls (usually the mean in our examples) results in a p-value that is smaller than (), this means that probability of observing this value is more unlikely than the significance level we allowed for. This means that (H_o) has to be rejected. In other words, the area of the p-value is smaller than that allowed by ().\n\n\nThe significance level () of a statistical hypothesis test is the largest p-value that would result in rejecting (H_o). Any p-value less than or equal to () results in (H_o) being rejected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState the null hypothesis (H_o: =_o) and the alternative hypothesis (H_1).\n\n\nState the significance level ().\n\n\nCalculate the p-value.\n\n\nReject (H_o) if p-value &lt; (), otherwise do not reject (H_o).\n\n\nInterpret your decision in the context of the problem.

The p-value can be found by calculating (P(X&lt;25)) for the normal distribution of the sample which is ( N(23.75,) ). p-value =NORM.DIST(23.75,25,3.97/SQRT(36),TRUE)=0.029434609‚Ä¶ Since, 0.029434609 &lt; 0.05, it means that the p-value is less than the significance level (). Translated into English, this means that the probability that we would observe this mean given the null hypothesis is true, is smaller than the given significance level. In other words, it is really unlikely. It is so unlikely that we do not want to assume that it is due to sample variability. Therefore we reject (H_o) in favour of the alternative hypothesis (H_1). This means that although new users might spend 25 minutes on the app on average, the data we have from the sample suggests strongly that this is not the case and we therefore reject the claim."

In this case, the p-value &gt; 0.1 so there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nWe therefore cannot conclude that the average fat content is different from 16 grams.\n\n\n\n\nWe are often interested in comparing sets of results for the same group of individuals. For example, we might consider:\n\n\nrace times for a class of student at the start and finish of the athletics season\n\n\ntest results for students in a class at the start and end of a semester\n\n\nweight of sheep at the beginning and end of summer\n\n\nIn this situation we choose a random sample of individuals from the population, then use the data for this group to provide two sets of results for comparison.\nThe data can therefore be matched in pairs for each individual in the group. Notice that the two sets of results are not independent, since they come from the same sample group. However, the score in each set of results must be independent for the analysis to be meaningful.\n\nThe performance of 20 elite sprinters was monitored over a twelve month period.

Note that a positive difference means that the athlete ran faster than at the start. A negative difference means that they ran slower. State the hypotheses:\n\n\n(H_o: {start} = {end} )\n\n\n(H_1: {start} &gt; {end} )\n\n\nThen in Excel use the function =T.TEST(array1,array2,tails,type) to calculate the p-value. For array1 you select the data from the start row, then for array 2 the end row, then select ‚Äú1‚Äù for ‚Äúone tail‚Äù (since we‚Äôre only interested to see whether they sped up), and then ‚Äú1‚Äù again for ‚Äúpaired‚Äù. That will give you 0.029163177 = 0.029 (2dp). Since the p-value &lt; () we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative hypothesis. This means that we can conclude with 5% significance that the athletes improved.\n\n\n\nWe have just seen how two sets of results from a single sample can be compared. We now consider how population means are compared if they come from two different samples.\n\nTwo groups of seedlings were grown with different brands of compost: A and B.

Conduct a two-sample t-test at 5% significance level, to determine whether the claim is valid.\n\n\n\n(H_o: _B = _A) the heights of the seedlings grown in compost B are the same on average as the heights of seedlings grown using compost A.\n\n\n(H_1: _B &gt; _A) the heights of the seedlings grown in compost B are larger on average than the seedlings grown using compost A.\n\n\nIn Excel use the function =T.TEST(Array1, Array2,1,2) (Note: assume equal variances). This will give you the p-value at 0.422975072. Comparing the p-value with the significance level, 0.42‚Ä¶ &gt; 0.05. This means that at a 5% significance level we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and therefore we do not have evidence to claim that the Brand B compost will improve the growth of the seedlings more than Brand A."

The (^2) test compares the size of differences between the expected results and the observed results, given the size of the sample and the number of variables.\nTo do a (^2) GOF tests follow these steps:\n\n\nState the null hypothesis (H_o) and the alternative hypothesis (H_1).\n\n\nState the significance level ().\n\n\nCalculate the expected frequencies.\n\n\nCalculate the p-value using the df = number of categories-1 and use =CHISQ.TEST().\n\n\nReject (H_o) if p-value &lt; (), otherwise accept (_o).\n\n\nInterpret your decision in the context of the problem.\n\n\nNote that for the (^2) test you do not need to consider whether the test is one tailed or two tailed.\n\n\n\nThe data points should be frequencies or counts and not percentages or other forms of data.\n\n\nThe categories of the variables should be mutually exclusive. That is, each data point can only belong to one category.\n\n\nThe trials must be independent.\n\n\nThe expected frequencies should be at least five.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we want to know whether a die is fair or biased. A fair dice would be expected to land, more or less, on each number with the same probability.\nOur random variable (X) will be the number thrown. The sample space is therefore {1,2,3,4,5,6}. \nThe null Hypothesis (H_o): the probabilities of each outcome is ().\nThe alternative hypothesis (H_1): At least one of the probabilities is not ().\nLet the significance level be set at (). We are testing whether the observed frequencies of outcomes is significantly different from the expected frequencies.

It then quantifies how likely it is that the difference is so large. This is done by calculating the p-value using the (^2) distribution curve.\nIn practice, we will use Excel in order to do the calculations. The function =CHISQ.TEST() returns the p-value when you input the observed data and expected data and the degrees of freedom which for the GOF test is always (n-1) just like for the student t-distribution.\nIf the p-value is less than the significance level, it means that the sample data does not match the expected data from the population.\nSo, continuing on from the above example and using Excel: Input the observed and expected frequencies:\n\n Then use the command =CHISQ.TEST(actual_range, expected_range) where the ‚Äúactual range‚Äù is the observed frequencies and ‚Äúexpected range‚Äù is the expected frequencies It will return the value p = 0.016931016. Since (0.0169 &lt; 0.05 ), i.e.¬†the p-value is less than the significance level () at (0.05).\n\n\nThis means that the likelihood of the observed frequencies happening is less than 0.05, i.e.¬†very unlikely. This means that the observed frequencies are very unlikely to be generated by a fair die. The null hypothesis should therefore be rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis that the die is biased.\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the grades received by 151 university students taking a second year Computer Science course.\nThe following semester, a new coordinator is appointed for the course.

In this case, let us take the standard (= 5%).\nStep 3: Calculate the expected frequencies.\nThe table above is the observed frequency table. Similar as with the (^2) GOF test, we need the expected frequency table. We can use Excel for this. Copy and paste the above table into Excel twice: Then consider this part (the orange shaded) of the second copy of the table:\n\n\nThis is where the expected frequencies must go. Go to the cell with ‚Äú110‚Äù. This represents the number of males who do regular exercise. What is the number we would expect? () is the fraction of males out of the total. (208) is the number of people who said they do regular exercise. Hence the expected number of males that do regular exercise would be: (). Using Excel, you can thus find the expected frequency table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate the p-value. Now, as with the (^2) GOF test, we need to find the p-value. We use the same =CHISQ.TEST()  function in Excel, but instead of selecting columns (or rows), we select the (2 ) (orange) area of the observed and expected frequencies.\nThis gives us the p-value = 0.641312274.\nStep 5: Reject (H_o) if p-value &lt; (). Otherwise, do not reject (H_o).\nIn our example 0.64 &gt; 0.05 hence we do not reject the null hypothesis.\nStep 6: Interpret your decision in the context of the problem. In our example this means that the variables gender and regular exercise are independent."

    "text": "Sampling variability and Central Limit Theorem\n\nSampling variability\nWhenever two samples are taken from one population, they will be different from each other. This is called ‚Äúsampling variability‚Äù.\n\nWhy do we care about Sampling Variability?\n\nPet obesity is a growing problem in the UK: Overweight cats, dogs and rabbits are expected to outnumber healthy ones within the next five years. In fact, animals kept in captivity, all over the world, are at higher risk of weight-related health problems than their wild counterparts, and much research has been done over the past twenty years to better understand this problem. As a particular example, it is common for  lemurs living in captivity to be overweight , and the effects of this include higher risk of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as breeding and birthing problems in females. To investigate, we could compare data on the weights of captive lemurs to the weights of wild lemurs. It is not possible of course to collect data on the weights of all lemurs in the world, and so we must take samples of both wild and captive lemurs to compare. We then look at the mean weights of these two samples and compare them. This leads us to the following two questions.\n\n\nHow do we know that the mean weights of the samples are a good indication of the mean weight of all wild or captive lemurs? We know that, because of sampling variability, taking a different sample, even of the same size, will, in general, provide a different estimate. How can we measure the uncertainty of our estimate?\n\n\nSecondly, if the mean weight of the captive lemurs is higher than the mean weight of the wild lemurs, can we say for sure that the mean weight of all captive lemurs is higher than the mean weight of all wild lemurs? Again, because of sampling variability, taking a different sample might give us a different answer to this question. How big does the difference in mean weights need to be for us to be reasonably certain that our outcome is not simply due to chance?\n\n\n\nExample\nLet us study how sample statistics differs from sample to sample. Consider the distribution of the heights of 3000 prisoners. It is known that the population consists of the 3000 prisoners, has a mean height of (= 65.47 ) inches and a standard deviation of (= 2.557) inches. The two population parameters are therefore the mean height and standard deviation. We will also assume that the heights of the prisoners follow a normal distribution. (X N(65.47,2.557^2)). The population parameter of interest is the mean height. You can see that the heights follow a normal distribution in the interactive graph below, where the heights of prisoners are shown in the pale blue histogram, and the normal distribution curve is fitted over the top.\n\nSampling\n\nIf, rather than having data on all 3000 prisoners, we only had data on 1000, then how well would the the sample statistic (in this case the mean) match the population parameter? We know that, because of sampling variability, each sample of 1000 prisoners will be different with a different sample statistics. But how different? Below, we explore the properties of different samples of 1000 prisoners, and see how the population parameter and sample statistic compare. The interactive graph below allows you to repeatedly take samples of 1000 prisoners. The light blue histogram represents the population distribution. The dark blue histogram shows the heights of the sampled prisoners. Press the ‚ÄúSample‚Äù button to obtain a new sample of the heights of 1000 prisoners. Note two things as you press ‚Äúsample‚Äù: how the general shape of the distributions differs and how the population and sample mean compare.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how closely the sample‚Äôs shape mirrors the shape of the distribution of the whole population of 3000 prisoners although it is of course lower as it only represents 1000 prisoners not 3000. But you can also see how the sample mean differs slightly from the population mean and from one sample to another. This is an example of sampling variability.\n\n\n\nThe Sample statistic as a random variable!\nUsing the sampling graph of the data of the prisoners, you were able to see see how the mean height of a sample of 1000 prisoners varies from the mean height of the entire population of prisoners. Most of the time, the sample mean is close to the population mean, but occasionally it will be a little further away. The sample mean itself can be considered a random variable () with its own probability distribution. Note that the line on the (X) indicates that it represents a mean. The sample means follow a normal distribution (Central limit theorem). After taking many many samples with sample size (n = 1000), we can find that the sample mean () follows a normal distribution with mean 65.47 and variance 0.0065. This means that the mean of all the samples taken is a height of 65.47 inches, with a variance of 0.0065 inches. i.e.¬†( N(65.47, 0.0065) ). The associated probability distribution function is shown in the interactive graph below.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this graph tell us? Remember, this is a distribution of means! The graph tells us that the mean height of a sample of 1000 prisoners will lie within a given range of values with a probability that can be calculated. For instance, consider the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the probability that the mean height of a sample of 1000 prisoners will lie between (65.38) and (65.6)?‚Äù Answer: We can use the above graph to find that the probability is [P(65.38 x ) ] Using Excel, you need to use the command =NORM.DIST(). In this case, the command in total should be: =NORM.DIST(65.5,65.47,sqrt(0.0065),TRUE)-NORM.DIST(65.38,65.47,sqrt(0.0065),TRUE). The result is (0.512948194‚Ä¶ ) (2sf)"

You might not be able to picture it exactly, but you might have the intuition that although it starts by falling quite slowly, it accelerates and becomes faster and faster in its fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed at which it falls increases because gravity pulls it towards the ground (centre of the mass of earth). Most of the time we consider the strength of the gravitational pull to be a constant, so the speed at which the stone is accelerating in a linear fashion, i.e. the amount that it speeds up is the same every second. This also means that the increasing speed can be modelled by a linear function (straight line with a positive gradient) and the acceleration by a constant function (a horizontal line).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the distance that it travelled down from where you initially held it? This is clearly also increasing. And it is increasing by the speed that it has. So as the speed increases, the rate of that the displacement increases, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are acceleration, velocity, and distance travelled related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the gradient of a straight line is a constant; the very definition of a straight line is that the \\(y\\) value increases in a constant fashion.

On the other hand, the sequence \\[\n  2, 6, 13, 23, 36, 52, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a quadratic fashion because it increases first by \\(4\\), then by \\(7\\), then \\(10\\), \\(13\\), \\(16\\), and so on by the linear sequence that we just had before.\nThe gradient (or rate of change) of a quadratic is a linear function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of change of velocity is called acceleration.

This includes differentiation and integration, both of which we will cover over the next couple of sections.\nThe subject has a really long history and, unfortunately for everyone, there was a historical spat between Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton, two famous scientists of the 17th and 18th century, when calculus was developed.\nThey both invented (or discovered depending on your philosophy) calculus around the same time and came up with different notations. To top it off, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, another scientist from that era invented yet more notation for the same ideas:\n\nLeibniz‚Äô notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}y\\),\nNewton‚Äôs notation: \\(\\dot{y}\\),\nLagrange‚Äôs notation: \\(y'\\).\n\nAll three are reasonably common, so it‚Äôs good to be aware of them.\n\n\nWe considered the gradient of a straight line. Now let us generalise this to other types of functions. The derivative at a certain point is the measurement of how much the function increases or decreases at that point. Consider the graph below. Pay attention to how the gradient decreases and increases, where it is negative and where positive.\n\n\n\n\nIn a weird twist of events, the value of the gradient/derivative can also be considered as a function in its own right and we call that function, the ‚Äúgradient function‚Äù and denote it \\(f'(x)\\).\nLet us consider this: the gradient of a graph can itself be represented by a graph. Consider again the parabola:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the gradient function of the parabola is described by a straight line graph. When the gradient of the parabola at its vertex has the value \\(0\\), its gradient function has the \\(y\\) value \\(0\\) (i.e.¬†it intercepts the x-axis). When the parabola is moving up, the straight line has positive \\(y-\\)coordinates (i.e.¬†it‚Äôs above the \\(x-\\)axis. When the graph moves down (the basketball is falling), then the rate of change of its height is negative, so the gradient function is below the \\(x-\\)axis.\nNow we can consider the graph of a cubic and it‚Äôs gradient function (derivative). Move the slider to move point A the cubic graph \\(f(x)\\) to see the corresponding value of the gradient/rate of change/derivative at that point and the corresponding \\(y\\) value of the quadratic gradient/derivative function \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the gradient of the line \\(f(x) = x\\) has a gradient of 1 as each time it goes ‚Äú1 across‚Äù is also ‚Äúgoes one up‚Äù. Note that the graph of \\(f'(x)\\) is \\(f'(x)=1\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, consider the gradients of the following straight lines. Use the slider to change how steep the lines are and observe the graph and value of \\(f'(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see that the gradient of \\(f(x)=cx\\) is going to be \\(c\\). In fact, you already know this fact if you remember \\(y=mx+c\\) where \\(m\\) stands for the gradient and \\(c\\) stands for the y-intercept, the point on the y-axis where the straight line crosses. Since in our example above this is always at the origin, i.e. \\(c = 0\\), this means that the gradient function \\(f'(x)=m\\) for all \\(f(x)=mx\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a line\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(f(x) = mx+c\\). Then \\(f'(x) = m\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x\\) then \\(f'(x)=5\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=9x\\) then \\(f'(x)=9\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=x+91\\) then \\(f'(x)=1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=-x\\) then \\(f'(x)=-1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x\\) then \\(f'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw that the gradient of a straight line is a constant (that we usually call ‚Äú\\(m\\)‚Äù) and which can be represented by a horizontal line \\(y=m\\). We also argued when talking about acceleration that the gradient of a parabola is given by a straight line (i.e. the gradient increases in a linear manner).\nThis can be generalised further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a general integer power.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) where \\(n\\) is a whole number, then its gradient function \\(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\), a polynomial of degree \\(n-1\\).\n\n\nRecall that \\(x^0 = 1\\) for all values of \\(x\\). From this and the above, we also have that a constant function, \\(f(x) = c\\) for all \\(x\\), the gradient is \\(f'(x) = {(c\\times x^{0})}' = c\\times0x^{-1} = 0\\) for all \\(x\\). In other words, the constant function has no gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x^7\\), what is \\(f'(x)\\)?\n\nBy the above, the gradient of \\(x^7\\) is \\(7x^{7-1} = 7x^6\\). Multiplying this by \\(5\\) gives that \\(f'(x)=35x^6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10\\)?\n\nWe can either apply the above rule to each individual term of the polynomial (e.g.¬†\\({(7x^2)}' = 7\\times2x^{2-1}=14x\\)) or computational software. For example, in Wolfram Alpha using derivative of f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10 returns \\(f'(x) = 20x^4 + 14x - 8\\). So the gradient of a polynomial of degree 5 is a polynomial function of power 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this can be further generalised to include cases where \\(n\\) is not an integer (a whole number, either positive or negative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of arbitrary powers\n\n\n\n\\((x^{a})' = ax^{a-1}\\) for any \\(x&gt;0\\) and any \\(a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(y=5x-\\sqrt{x}\\)?\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}\\), it follows from our rules for powers that \\[\n  {(\\sqrt{x})}' = x^{0.5-1} = x^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{x^{0.5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}.\n\\] Then we have that \\(y'=5-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the derivative of \\(f(x) = 4\\sqrt{x}+ \\frac{7}{x} - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\)?\n\nWe note that this can be written as \\(f(x) = 4x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7x^{-1} - x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Then by applying to above rule to each term, \\[\n  f'(x) = 4\\times\\frac{1}{2} \\times x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - 7x^{-2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\times x^{-\\frac{2}{3}}.\n\\] This can be simplified to \\(f'(x)= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{x}}-\\frac{7}{x^2} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\)."

What is special about these places? There are some values where the gradient is positive, and some where it‚Äôs negative. And this repeats periodically.\nWhat graph or function do you know that has periodicity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nFor the trig functions:\n\n\\(y = \\sin(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = \\cos(x)\\)\n\\(y = \\cos(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = -\\sin(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)= 4x + sin(3x)\\), find \\(f'(x)\\).\n\nWe know from the above that the derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(\\cos(x)\\), and the derivative of \\(3x\\) is \\(3\\). Letting \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(g(x) = 3x\\) gives the composition \\(f(g(x)) = \\sin(3x)\\). Then, by the chain rule, the derivative of the composition is\\[\n  f'(g(x))\\times g'(x) = \\cos(3x)\\times 3 = 3\\cos(3x).\n\\] We can also find that by typing in differentiate f(x) = 4x + sin(3x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nThe height of the tide in a harbour can be modelled by the graph \\(H(t)=4.8 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}(t+3)) + 5.1\\) where \\(H(t)\\) is measured in metres and \\(t\\) is measured in hours after midnight.

Initially, the rate at which is was cooling down was quite rapid. This was because the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air became smaller (decreased), the rate at which the coffee continued to cool down slowed down.\nAs the coffee neared the temperature of the surrounding air, a fictional \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\), the coffee would stop cooling down as there was now very little difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature.\nConsider the following interactive graph. Move the point A. As time increases, the \\(y\\) ‚ÄúTemperature‚Äù value decreases as the temperature of the tea is decreasing. The gradient is therefore negative (you can see the value).\nThe gradient function is represented by the blue graph. You can see that it remains below the \\(x-\\)axis even as it comes closer and closer to the \\(x-\\)axis. This represents the fact that although the tea (or coffee) keeps getting colder (as it approaches the ambient temperature), the rate of decrease becomes more and more smaller.\n\n\n\n\nYou might be able to see that, even if the blue graph is upside down, it has the same general shape as the green graph which represents the temperature of Douglas‚Äô coffee. In fact, the gradient of an exponential function is another exponential function. The rate of change of a quantity that increases or decreases in an exponential fashion is itself exponential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nLet \\(y=2^x\\). Use the command differentiate y=2^x to obtain the answer: \\(y'=2^x log(2)\\) or if you use the approximate values: \\(y' =0.693147 2^x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(f(x)=18 \\times 9.1x^{3x}+7x\\).

Part of what makes these particularly important for growth models from biology or economics is the following property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nIf \\(y = e^x\\), then \\(y' = e^x\\) also. That is, the natural exponential is a function where the graph of the function and the graph of its gradient are the same.\n\n\nWe can then combine this with the other rules to work out exponential derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(h(x)=18 \\times e^{3x}+11\\).

    "text": "We have talked about how exponentials can model growth, but in our day to day we don‚Äôt always encounter growth in this continuous way as a curve. Rather, we encounter it in a discrete way as a sequence.\n\n\nSay I set myself a New Years resolution of reading more. At the moment I read about 3 pages per night, but I have the idea to increase this by two pages every day in January. On the January 1st I‚Äôll read 5 pages, on Jan 2nd read 7 pages, on Jan 3rd read 9 pages, and so on.\nThe number of pages I will is a sequence: [ 5, 7, 9, . ] The (n^{}) term in a sequence is denoted (a_n), so here (a_1 = 5), (a_2 = 7), etc. By observation we might be able to see that on the (n^{}) day I will have read (3+2n) pages, so here (a_n = 3+2n).\nThis means that we can work out a given term in the sequence without calculating all the intermediate terms. For example, on January 31st I‚Äôll read (a_{31} = 3 + 2 = 65) pages.\nIn general, We define the (n^{}) term of an arithmetic sequence as (a_n = a_0 + nd), where (a_0) is our starting value and (d) is the difference we move by each term. So in the previous example, (a_0 = 3) and (d = 2).\nSuppose now I want to find how many pages (S) I will read in January total. This would be the [ S = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{31}. ] We could compute this by hand, but there exists a handy formula [ S_n = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{n} = . ] This sum is called an arithmetic series and you may also see this sum denoted using ‚Äòsigma‚Äô notation [ S_n = {m=1}^{n} a_m = . ] For my reading goal, that means [ S{31} = _{n=1}^{31}(3+2n) = = = 1085. ] That‚Äôs almost the same number of pages as War and Peace, so probably not realistic as resolutions go!\n\n\n\nAnother context where growth comes up is in savings or interest. Say I put (50) in a savings account with 2% annual interest. That is, at the end of the year 2% of the total balance is added extra by the bank.\nAt the end of the first year, it will contain (50 + 2%50 = 50 + 1 = 51). Next year though, (2%) of my balance isn‚Äôt (1) any more, it‚Äôs (2%51 = 1.02).\nBy remembering that increasing by (2%) is the same as multiply by (1 + = 1.02), we can put To put it back in the language of sequences as \\[\\begin{align*}\n  a_0 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\\\\n  a_1 &= \\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_2 &= (\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n  a_3 &= ((\\text{¬£}50 \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02) \\times 1.02 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\\] or, simplifying using powers, (a_n = ^n). That means in thirty five years my savings pot will be a whole [ a_{35} = 50^{35} = 99.99448. ] Well, (99.99) isn‚Äôt nothing, but it‚Äôs certainly not a retirement fund.\nIn general, We define the (n^{}) term of an geometric sequence as (a_n = a_0 r^n), where (a_0) is our starting value and (r) is the common ratio we increase by each term. So in the previous example, (a_0 = 50) and (r = 1.02). Similar to before, we can compute the sum of these terms - the geometric series - as [ S_n = a_1 + a_2 + + a_{n} = . ] This formula doesn‚Äôt hold when (r = 1) since it would require dividing by zero, though in that case the value of (S_n) can be worked out directly from its definition."

That is why we have to add ‚Äú+c‚Äù at the end of the integration.\n\n\nReturning to the example above, we can write the indefinite integral \\(\\int 2x\\;dx = x^2+c\\) where the +c means that we not know which of the parabolas we need.\n\n\n\n$ 6x^2 +2x ;dx = 2x3+x2+ c $; Wolfram Alpha will remind you by stating ‚Äú+constant‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n$ -12x^{11} +x -15 ;dx = -x^{12} + x^2 -15x +c $\n\n\n\n\nDefinite integration returns a value (a number) rather than a function. Instead of the ‚Äú+c‚Äù we use square brackets and substitute limits into the integral. Instead of ‚Äú+c‚Äù we use square brackets!\nThe notation is:\\[ \\int_b^af(x)\\;dx = [F(x)]^a_b = F(a)-F(b) \\]\nYou will not need to know how to write this, but you will need to interpret what the notation represents. The most direct reason that we use this technique is to calculate the area underneath a curve.\n\n\n\nSplitting up an integral into two parts\n\n\nThe light grey area in this image can be represented by $ ^a_bf(x);dx = [F(x)]^a_b = F(a)-F(b) $. The blue area is represented by $ ^b_c f(x);dx = [F(x)]^b_c = F(b)-F(c) $.\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph \\(y=6x^2 -9x+7\\) for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 8\\).\n\narea under y=6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8 or integrate 6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8 or integrate 6x^2 -9x+7, from 0 to 8.\n \nThe area underneath the graph is \\(792 ~units^2\\)\n\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph \\(y=5-x\\) for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 5\\).\n\narea under y=5-x, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 5 or integrate 5-x, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 5 or integrate 5-x, from 0 to 5.\n\nNote:\n\nThe area underneath the graph is \\(-12.5~units^2\\). Note that the area is negative. This is because it is below the x-axis. In real life, areas are never negative, but in applications, the area can represent for instance velocity or accumulated profit which of course, then would actually represent growing loss.\nThe area could have been calculated using the formula of area of a triangle \\(A=\\frac12~base \\times ~height\\). In this case it would have been \\(A=\\frac12 5 \\times 5 = 12.5 ~units^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the shaded area underneath the graph \\(y=3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2\\).\n\n\nStep 1. Find where the graph intercepts the \\(x-\\)axis. This is done using the command intercepts. intercepts 3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2 which returns \\(x=-1.5\\) and \\(x=5\\).\nStep 2. Integrate using these intercepts as limits.integrate y=3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2 from -1.5 to 5.\n\nThe area underneath the graph is \\(18.3083 ~units^2 \\approx 18.31 ~units^2~(2dp)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(f'(x)=6x+1\\). It is given that \\(f(5)=14\\). Find the expression for \\(f(x)\\).\n\nStep 1: Find the indefinite integral \\(f(x)=\\int 6x+1~dx = 3x^2 + x + c\\) (do not forget the +c !!)\nStep 2: Substitute the ‚Äúinitial values‚Äù to find the value of \\(c\\)\nSince we are told that \\(f(5)=14\\) we need to substitute \\(x=5\\) into the expression and set it equal to \\(14\\). Use Wolfram Alpha, ‚Äú3x^2 + x + c where x=5‚Äù. This simplifies to: 80+c\nNext, make that expression equal to \\(14\\), i.e.¬†enter the command ‚Äú80+c=14‚Äù to find the value of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(f(x) =3x^2 + x - 66\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe acceleration of a particle is given by \\(a(t)=8t^3 - 5t +9\\). It is known that the velocity of the initial velocity of the particle is \\(5 m/s\\). Find the function of the velocity.\n\nStep 1: Find the indefinite integral \\(v(t)=\\int a(t) dx = \\int 8x^3 - 5x +9 ~dx = 2t^4 - \\frac52 t^2 + 9t + c\\) (Using Wolfram Alpha integrate command)\n\nStep 2: Use the initial values to find the value of the ‚Äúconstant of integration \\(c\\)‚Äù The question tells us that the initial velocity \\(v_o\\) is \\(5 m/s\\). This means that \\(v(0) = 5\\).\nTo find what the value of \\(c\\) you need to substitute \\(t=0\\) and set the expression equal to 5.\nType: 2t^4 - 5/2 t^2 + 9t + c when t=0‚Äú`. This will return simply‚Äùc‚Äù. Therefore, \\(c=5\\).\nTherefore the function for the velocity is \\(v(t)=2t^4 - \\frac52 t^2 + 9t + 5\\).\n\n\n\nFind the expression for \\(g(t)\\) given that $g‚Äô(t) = $ and it is known that \\(g(x)\\) passes through the point \\((7,5)\\).\nStep 1: Find the indefinite integral Using the command integrate sqrt(2x-5) which results in:\n\nSo, \\(g(t)=\\frac13(2t-5)^{\\frac32}+c\\).\nStep 2: Use the initial values to find the value of the ‚Äúconstant of integration \\(c\\)‚Äù Now, we need to use the information that the graph passes through the point \\((7,5)\\). Substitute these values into\\(g(t)=\\frac{1}{3}(2t-5)^{\\frac{3}{2}}+c\\) and then solve for \\(c\\).\nIn other words, first use the command 1/3*(2t-5)^(3/2)+c when t=7 This results in: 9+c.¬†Set this expression equal to 5 so you have the command ‚Äú9 +c = 5‚Äù and the result will give you:\n\nTherefore, \\(g(t)=\\frac13(2t-5)^{\\frac32}-4\\)\n\n\n\nFind the expression for \\(k(x)\\) given that $k‚Äô(x) = (x) $ and that $k() = 0.1 $. Step 1. Find the indefinite integral using the command ‚Äúintegrate cos(pi x)‚Äù which results in\n\nSo, \\(k(x)=\\frac{sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi} + c\\).\nStep 2. Substitute $k() = 0.1 $ into the above expression:\n\\[\\frac{sin(\\pi \\times \\frac12)}{\\pi} + c = 0.1\\]\nThen solve for \\(c\\). Use the command: ‚Äúsin(pi 1/2)/pi + c =0.1‚Äù. This will give you \\(c=-0.21831 \\approx -0.22~(2dp)\\)Therefore, \\(k(x)=\\frac{sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi} -0.22\\)"

    "text": "To calculate the theoretical probability of an event, we need to know the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) of an experiment.\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for when we roll a die (the singular of dice) is the set of the six possible outcomes \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\). In this case, all these outcomes are equally likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen each outcome of an experiment is equally likely, the probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes contained within the event by the total number of outcomes of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs the probablity of rolling a 4?\n\nThere are 4 outcomes in the sample space \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\).

In other cases, we cannot figure out the probability of an event using logic alone.\nFor example, if we wanted to know the probability that a woman from a particular population will be between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, we need to collect data, i.e. measure the heights of a large number of women in that population to see how many are between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, and use this to estimate the probability for the whole population.\nWe call such a probability an experimental probability.\n\n\n\nConsider the graph below. On the horizontal axis, we have the number of times a fair six-sided dice was rolled. On the vertical axis we have value from 1 to 6. The graph represents the average of the results. As the number of times that you roll the die increases, the closer the average comes to the mean average between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\): \\(3.5\\).\n\n\n\n{wallet}\n\n\nThis is called the Law of large numbers. In concrete terms, says that the proportion of the outcomes will approximate their theoretical probabilities as the number of trials increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nIf we throw a dice ten times, it is unlikely2 that all six possible outcomes will be equally represented in the outcome. But if you increase the number of times that you roll the dice, each outcome will be more and more equally represented. Set the number of dice to one and then use this Geogebra page to see how the outcomes even out as you throw the dice more often.\n\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll return to this example in this weeks workshops, looking at how the number of dice impacts the outcomes."

    "text": "Watch this short video (4:31min) from TED- Ed. Be ready to pause the video to solve the riddle when the video asks you to.\n\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cpwSGsb-rTs\nWe will come back to this example in a moment. But first, definitions and vocabulary: A conditional probability is the probability that an event occurs, given that some other event has occurred. For example, it is known that people who smoke are more likely to get lung cancer than those who do not. The probability that an arbitrary person will get lung cancer is quite low, but the probability that a person will get lung cancer, given that they smoke, is much higher. Given an event \\(A\\) and an event \\(B\\), we write the probability that \\(A\\) occurs, given that \\(B\\) has already happened, as \\(P(A | B)\\). In the above example, we might write \\(A\\) for the event that a person gets lung cancer, and \\(B\\) for the event that that person smokes. Then the probability of a person getting lung cancer, given that they smoke, is \\(P(A | B)\\). For our Frog Riddle example, event \\(A\\) is the croak, event \\(B\\) is that you get the anti-dote to the poison in the mushroom (i.e.¬†you find a female frog). If you walk right, the probability that you find a female frog is \\(50\\%\\). If you walk left, the probability is \\(P(B | A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\nConditional probability is important when looking at probabilities of multiple events that are dependent. In the above example, the events \\(A\\) (a person gets lung cancer) and \\(B\\) (a person smokes) are dependent on one another, because whether or not someone smokes affects the probability that they get lung cancer.\nWe can use conditional probabilities to test whether or not two events are dependent: Two events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent only if \\(P(A|B) = P(A)\\), and \\(P(B|A) = P(B)\\). The probability that someone gets lung cancer given that they smoke is greater than the general probability that they will get lung cancer, and so \\(P(A|B)\\) is not equal to \\(P(A)\\). Therefore, events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are dependent on one another. For our Frog riddle example, the two events \\(A\\) ‚Äúcroak‚Äù and \\(B\\) ‚Äúone of the two frogs in female‚Äù are clearly not independent because the croak tells us that least one of the two frogs is male. The probability that if you have two frogs at least one of them is female is \\(P(B)=\\frac{3}{4} =0.75\\), but given the croak, \\(P(B|A)=\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 67\\%\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nSuppose a bag contains \\(10\\) balls, \\(6\\) red and \\(4\\) blue. Two balls are chosen (without replacement) at random, one after the other. Consider the two events \\(R,\\ B\\):\n\n\\(R\\) is event ‚Äúfirst ball chosen is red‚Äô‚Äô \\(B\\) is event‚Äùsecond ball chosen is blue‚Äô‚Äô\n\nShow that the probability of picking a blue ball second is different to picking a blue ball second given that the first chosen ball was red. Solution Perhaps the easiest way of thinking about and calculating with conditional probabilities is to use a tree diagram. In fact, we have met some conditional probabilities in disguise when we examined tree diagrams in the previous section. Creating a tree diagram for the above situation gives the following:\n\n Rewriting the branches of this diagram with our above conditional probability notation then gives:\n\n Thus, we can read off the probability of picking a blue ball second given the first ball was red by looking at the second from top branch of the diagram. Thus, \\[ P(B|R) = \\frac{4}{9}.\\] We can work out the probability of picking a blue ball second by adding up the probability of each branch involving picking a blue ball second, that is \\[ P(B) = P(B|R) + P(B|R')= \\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{7}{9}.\\]\n\n\n\nGiven two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) then the conditional probability \\(\\text{P}(B|A)\\) is given by: \\[ P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)} \\qquad \\text{or, equivalently} \\qquad P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A).\\]\n\n\nThe top shelf has 3 cans of chicken noodle soup and 2 cans of tomato soup. The bottom shelf contains 4 cans of tomoto soup and 1 can of chicken noodle soup. Because it is easier, we are twice as likely to take a can from the bottom shelf (\\(P(bottom)=\\frac{2}{3}\\)) as we are from the top shelf (\\(P(top)=\\frac{1}{3}\\)).\n\n\nSuppose we take a can of soup without paying attention to which one it is, what isa) the probability that is chicken noodle? b) the probability that the can was taken from the top shelf, given that it is chicken noodle soup? Solution\nLet event \\(T\\): the can was taken from the top shelf. \\(C\\): the chosen soup is chicken noodle soup. The probability that the soup is a chicken noodle soup is \\(P(C)\\). It can be chosen from the top or bottom shelf so \\[P(C) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} +\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{5}  = \\frac{5}{15}\\] The probability that it was taken from the top shelf, given that it is chicken noodle soup is \\(P(T|C)\\). Using the formula $ P(T | C) = $ we realise that we have \\(P(C)\\) but not yet the probability that the soup was chosen form the top shelf AND was chicken noodle \\(P(T \\cap C)\\). \\[P(C \\cap T) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5}\n= \\frac{3}{15}\\]. Using the above formula for conditional probability \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{P(T \\cap C)}{P(C)} \\] we therefore have \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{15}}{\\frac{5}{15}} = \\frac35\\] So the probability that the mushroom soup came from the top shelf is \\(0.6\\). Note that the order is important. If we asked, what is the probability that it is chicken noodle soup, given that the can came from the top shelf, the answer would be \\[ P(C | T) = \\frac{P(T \\cap C)}{P(T)} \\] we therefore have \\[ P(T | C) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{15}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{9}{15}=\\frac35\\] which makes sense given that there are three chicken noodle soups out of five on the top shelf."
