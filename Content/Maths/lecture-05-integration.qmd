# Integration

The previous section discussed differentiation. This is just one aspect of calculus though, the other being integration.

## Introduction

Many operations in mathematics have "inverse operations" (the mathematical version of CTRL+Z).

![](images/09/intro-inverse1.png)

This means for instance that if you add 2 to a number, subtracting 2 from it will bring you back to the original number. If you square a number, for instance $9^2$, you obtain $81$. If you square root the $81$, $(\sqrt{81})$, you return back to $9$. 

![](images/09/intro-inverse2.png)

Differentiation also has it's "undo" operation. It is called integration.
Together, differentiation and integration make up what is known as calculus or even "the calculus".Sometimes, integration is known as the "anti-derivative" because it is in a way the inverse operation to differentiation.

### Anti-derivative

The integral of a function $f(x)$ is sometimes referred to as the "anti-derivative" because it is the inverse operation of finding the derivative.

A little bit of notation: The integral of the function $f(x)$ is a function whose derivative is $f(x)$. So if $f'(x)$ is the derivative of function $f(x)$, then $f(x)$ is the integral of $f'(x)$. Often the integral is denoted using a capital letter.

So $F(x)$ is the integral of $f(x)$. This means that $F'(x)=f(x)$.

You can think of integral being the result of "undoing differentiation". 

![](images/09/4_0_3antideriv.png)

![](images/09/anti-derivative.png)

#### Example {-}

> Find the integral of $f(x)$ where $f(x)=\cos(x)$.

Since $(\sin(x))'=\cos(x)$, we have that $\sin(x)$ is integral of $\cos(x)$.

Note that since also $(\sin(x)+5)'=\cos(x)$, we have that $\sin(x)+5$ is **also** an integral of $\cos(x)$. In fact, there are an infinite number of possible integrals.

In fact, we need to write $F(x)=sin(x)+c$. This $"c"$ will be explained later. For now, remember that a constant needs to be added each time. "+c".

### Notation

In differentiating you had to learn two different notations. For integration there is one notation:$\int$ $dx$. The function that will be integrated, $f(x)$, is called the integrand. It is written between the integration sign (the taaaaaal S which you can think of as "infinite sum") $\int$ and the $dx$ which represents the **infinitesimal**. So the integral is really "the infinite sum of infinitesimally small things". Which is actually what it is (but this course will not go into this...). 

$$
  \int{f(x)} dx = F(x) + c.
$$

#### Examples {-}

In Wolfram Alpha, use the command "integrate". Let $y=2$. What is the integral? You need to integrate.

> $ \int{2}~dx = 2x+c$

Remember that $(2x)' = 2$, i.e. the gradient of the straight line $y=2x$ is $m=2$. 

> $ \int{x}~dx = \frac12 x^2+c$

Remember the gradient of a quadratic function can be represented by a straight line as in our opening example using acceleration, velocity and displacement.

> $ \int{\sin(x)}~dx = -\cos(x)+c$

Remember that $(cos(x))' = - \sin(x)$.

Practice your syntax:

> $\int{2^{3x}-4 \cos(6x)~dx} $

`integrate 2^(3x)-4cos(6x)`

> $\int{2^{3x}-4 \cos(6x)~dx} = \frac{8^x}{log(8)} - \frac23 \sin(6x) +c$ 

Remember to compare your answer with the way it appears in Wolfram Alpha.

## Integration

Integration challenges in this course comes in three forms: 

1. Indefinite integration, which can be remembered as "+c"
2. Definite integration, which can be remembered as "from .... to" (Square brackets).
3. Initial Value Problem. An extension of 1.

### Indefinite integration "+c"

When we differentiated, there was always just one gradient for a given function.
Consider the interactive graph below. There are three parabolas. You can move the red one up and down by changing the value of $c$. Move the blue point and see how the gradient changes.

<center><iframe width="900" height="400" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/t2bbvhfb/width/1400/height/567/border/888888/sri/true/sdz/true" scrolling="no" style="border: 0px;" alt="..."> </iframe></center>

> The **indefinite integral** $\displaystyle\int f(x)\,dx=F(x)+c$

Hope you can see that all three parabolas have the same gradient $2x$ where $x$ is the $x-$coordinate of the point where the gradient is being measured. In other words, given $f(x)$, there's an infinite number of graphs/functions that have this particular gradient.

![](images/09/indefinite-integral.png)

So without more information, we cannot know what constant disappeared when we differentiated and should reappear when we integrate. That is why we have to add "+c" at the end of the integration. 

#### Example A {-}

Returning to the example above, we can write the indefinite integral $\int 2x\;dx = x^2+c$ where the +c means that we not know which of the parabolas we need. 

#### Example B {-}

$ \int 6x^2 +2x \;dx = 2x^3+x^2+ c $; Wolfram Alpha will remind you by stating "+constant".

![](images/09/indefinite-example.png)

#### Example C {-}

$ \int -12x^{11} +x -15 \;dx = -x^{12} +\frac12 x^2 -15x +c $

### Definite Integrals

Definite integration returns a value (a number) rather than a function. Instead of the "+c" we use square brackets and substitute limits into the integral. Instead of "+c" we use square brackets!

The notation is:$$ \int_b^af(x)\;dx = [F(x)]^a_b = F(a)-F(b) $$

You will not need to know how to write this, but you will need to interpret what the notation represents. The most direct reason that we use this technique is to calculate the area underneath a curve. 

![Splitting up an integral into two parts](images/09/4_3_1_property6.png)

The light grey area in this image can be represented by $ \int^a_bf(x)\;dx = [F(x)]^a_b = F(a)-F(b) $. The blue area is represented by $ \int^b_c f(x)\;dx = [F(x)]^b_c = F(b)-F(c) $. 

#### Example A {-}

> Find the area underneath the graph $y=6x^2 -9x+7$ for $0 \leq x \leq 8$. 

`area under y=6x^2 -9x+7, 0 <= x <= 8` or `integrate 6x^2 -9x+7, 0 <= x <= 8` or `integrate 6x^2 -9x+7, from 0 to 8`. 

![](images/09/definite-example1.png)
![](images/09/definite-example2.png)

The area underneath the graph is $792 ~units^2$  

#### Example B {-}

> Find the area underneath the graph $y=5-x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 5$.

`area under y=5-x, 0 <= x <= 5` or `integrate 5-x, 0 <= x <= 5` or `integrate 5-x, from 0 to 5`. 

![](images/09/area-under-graph.png)

Note:

1. The area underneath the graph is $-12.5~units^2$. Note that the area is negative. This is because it is **below** the x-axis. In real life, areas are never negative, but in applications, the area can represent for instance velocity or accumulated profit which of course, then would actually represent growing loss.
2. The area could have been calculated using the formula of area of a triangle $A=\frac12~base \times ~height$. In this case it would have been $A=\frac12 5 \times 5 = 12.5 ~units^2$.

#### Example C {-}

> Find the shaded area underneath the graph $y=3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2$.

![](images/09/definite-example3.png)

Step 1. Find where the graph intercepts the $x-$axis. This is done using the command `intercepts`. `intercepts 3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2` which returns $x=-1.5$ and $x=5$.

Step 2. Integrate using these intercepts as limits.`integrate y=3 + 1.4 x - 0.4 x^2 from -1.5 to 5`.

![](images/09/definite-example4.png)

The area underneath the graph is $18.3083 ~units^2 \approx 18.31 ~units^2~(2dp)$  

### Initial value problem (IVP)

#### Example A {-}

> Let $f'(x)=6x+1$. It is given that $f(5)=14$. Find the expression for $f(x)$.

Step 1: Find the indefinite integral $f(x)=\int 6x+1~dx = 3x^2 + x + c$ (do not forget the +c !!)

Step 2: Substitute the "initial values" to find the value of $c$

Since we are told that $f(5)=14$ we need to substitute $x=5$ into the expression and set it equal to $14$. Use Wolfram Alpha, "3x^2 + x + c where x=5". This simplifies to: 80+c

Next, make that expression equal to $14$, i.e. enter the command "80+c=14" to find the value of $c$. 

![](images/09/ivp1.png)

Therefore, $f(x) =3x^2 + x - 66$.

#### Example B {-}

> The acceleration of a particle is given by $a(t)=8t^3 - 5t +9$. It is known that the velocity of the initial velocity of the particle is $5 m/s$. Find the function of the velocity.

Step 1: Find the indefinite integral $v(t)=\int a(t) dx = \int 8x^3 - 5x +9 ~dx = 2t^4 - \frac52 t^2 + 9t + c$ (Using Wolfram Alpha `integrate` command) 

![](images/09/ivp2.png)

Step 2: Use the initial values to find the value of the "constant of integration $c$" The question tells us that the initial velocity $v_o$ is $5 m/s$. This means that $v(0) = 5$.

To find what the value of $c$ you need to substitute $t=0$ and set the expression equal to 5.

Type: `2t^4 - 5/2 t^2 + 9t + c when t=0`"`. This will return simply "c". Therefore, $c=5$.  

Therefore the function for the velocity is $v(t)=2t^4 - \frac52 t^2 + 9t + 5$.  

#### Example C {-}

Find the expression for $g(t)$ given that $g'(t) = \sqrt{2x-5} $ and it is known that $g(x)$ passes through the point $(7,5)$.

Step 1: Find the indefinite integral Using the command `integrate sqrt(2x-5)` which results in: 

![](images/09/ivp3.png)

So, $g(t)=\frac13(2t-5)^{\frac32}+c$.

Step 2: Use the initial values to find the value of the "constant of integration $c$" Now, we need to use the information that the graph passes through the point $(7,5)$. Substitute these values into$g(t)=\frac{1}{3}(2t-5)^{\frac{3}{2}}+c$ and then solve for $c$.

In other words, first use the command `1/3*(2t-5)^(3/2)+c when t=7` This results in: 9+c. Set this expression equal to 5 so you have the command "9 +c = 5" and the result will give you:

![](images/09/ivp4.png)

Therefore, $g(t)=\frac13(2t-5)^{\frac32}-4$ 

#### Example D {-}

Find the expression for $k(x)$ given that $k'(x) = \cos(\pi x) $ and that $k(\frac12) = 0.1 $.
Step 1. Find the indefinite integral using the command "integrate cos(pi x)" which results in 

![](images/09/ivp5.png)

So, $k(x)=\frac{sin(\pi x)}{\pi} + c$.

Step 2. Substitute $k(\frac12) = 0.1 $ into the above expression:

$$\frac{sin(\pi \times \frac12)}{\pi} + c = 0.1$$

Then solve for $c$. Use the command: "sin(pi 1/2)/pi + c =0.1". This will give you $c=-0.21831 \approx -0.22~(2dp)$Therefore, $k(x)=\frac{sin(\pi x)}{\pi} -0.22$


## Applying Integration

So far, we've only looked at how to integrate but not really considered **why **one would want to integrate. Initially, we looked at the link between acceleration, velocity and displacement, but another important - and useful - application is for the computation of areas and volumes.

In general, integration is also important in the solving of of differential equations but that is a topic that we will not cover in this course. These can be used to model all sorts of real-world phenomena, including population growth, weather, and the motion of planets - so finding solutions is of great practical significance.

![](images/09/summary.png)

### Area under a curve

We are all familiar with finding the area of shapes like triangles, rectangles and circles.
But how can we go about finding areas which are more complicated, e.g. the area under the curve $y=x^2$?

![](images/09/area-under1.png)

Consider the graph of $y=x^2$. The blue shaded area is the area under the graph vertically between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x-$axis. We can get an estimate for the area from counting the number of square. You can see that there are more than eight squares shaded in (combine partial squares). To calculate the area under the curve we use integration. Area = $\int^3_0 f(x) ~dx = [ \frac{1}{3} x^3 ]^3_0 = \frac13 (3^3-0^3) = 9 \text{ units}^2 $.    

#### Example 1 {-}

> Find the area enclosed by the graph of $y= -\frac{9}{2} - \frac{3}{4} x + \frac14 x^2$ and the $x-$axis.

![](images/09/area-under2.png)

In Wolfram Alpha, use the command `area under-9/2 - (3 x)/4 + x^2/4` to obtain the area:

![](images/09/area-under3.png)

The area between the parabola and the $x-$axis is therefore $30.375 ~units^2$.  

#### Example 2 {-}

> Find the area between the sine curve $y=\sin(x)$ and the $x-$axis from $0$ to $2\pi$.

![](images/09/area-under4.png)

Use the command `area under sin(x) from 0 to 2pi`. It will give you:

![](images/09/area-under5.png)

So the area is $4 ~units^2$. 


Please note that integrating $y=sin(x)$ from $0$ to $2\pi$ would not result in the area between the graph and the curve. If you used the command `integrate sin(x) from 0 to pi` in Wolfram Alpha it returns 0. This is because integrating when a curve is under the x-axis results in a negative value, even as there is no such thing as negative areas.

### Areas between curves

So far we have used integration to find the area under a curve, or between a curve and the $x$-axis. Here, we will consider the more general case where the area we want to find is between two curves.
For example, how can we find the area of the region enclosed by $y=x^2$ and $y=x+2$?

![](images/09/10-2-1_parabola_line.png)

Notice that we could find this from two areas that we already know how to compute:

| ![](images/09/10-2-1_line_area.png) | ![](images/09/10-2-1_parabola_area.png) |
| :-: | :-: |
| The area under $y=x+2$ between $x=-1$ and $x=2$. | The area under $y=x^2$ between $x=-1$ and $x=2$ |
| $\displaystyle \int_{-1}^2 \left(x+2\right)\,dx$ | $\displaystyle \int_{-1}^2 \left(x^2\right)\,dx$ |

The area we want is the difference of these two, and by the properties of the definite integral we can write this as $$ \int_{-1}^2 \left(x+2\right)\,dx - \int_{-1}^2 \left(x^2\right)\,dx = \int_{-1}^2 \left(\left(x+2\right)-\left(x^2\right)\right)\,dx.
$$
So to find the area between theses two graphs, we ask Wolfram Alpha to `area between x^2 and x+1`

![](images/09/area-between-wolfram2.png)

So the area between the two curves is 4.5 $units^2$.

#### Example 1 {-}

> Find the area enclosed by the parabola $y=16-x^2$ and the line $y=7$.

In Wolfram Alpha, type `area between 16-x^2 and 7`.

![](images/09/area-between-wolfram.png)

The area between is therefore $36~units^2$.

#### Example 2 {-}

> Find the area between $y=sin(3x)$ and $y=5-e^x$ from the $y-axis$ to their point of intersection.

If you ask Wolfram Alpha to compute the area between the two graphs, it will tell you that "(could not compute the area between the curves)". This is because the area is infinitely large as you can see from the graph. 

But you can compute the area between two limits, and one might be to find the area between two curves from $x=0$ to their point of intersection, as in this example.

Step 1: Find the point of intersection by using the command "intersection sin(3x) and 5-e^x ". This will give you $x \approx 1.76413$. 

Step 2: Find the area from $0$ to the point of intersection between the two graphs. Use the command "area between sin(3x) and 5-e^x from 0 to 1.76413".

![](images/09/area-between.png)

The area is therefore $3.83~units^2$ (2dp).
