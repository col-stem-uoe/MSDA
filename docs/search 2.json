If you accidentally try to use one, R will warn you.\n\n\n\nObjects appear in the Environment pane\nAfter running a line such as:\n\nx &lt;- 5\n\nHere we have created an object called x with the value 5.

    "text": "R Syntax Basics: Your First Steps in Coding\nLet’s dive into the core elements of R syntax that you’ll encounter every day.\n\nComments: The Programmer’s Notes\nComments are lines in your code that R ignores. They are incredibly useful for you and others to understand what your code does, why you made certain choices, or to temporarily disable a line of code.\nIn R, you use the hash symbol # to indicate a comment.\n\nAnything after # on a line is treated as a comment.\n\nComments improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n\n# This is a single-line comment\nx &lt;- 10 # This comment explains what x is\n\n\n\nVariables and Assignment: Storing Your Data\nVariables are like named containers that hold values. You use them to store data (numbers, text, logical values) so you can refer to it and manipulate it later in your script. In R, the primary way to assign a value to a variable is using the assignment operator &lt;- (a less-than sign followed by a hyphen).\n\nYou can also use = for assignment, but &lt;- is generally preferred for clarity and consistency in R.\nVariable names should start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_) or periods (.).\nR is case-sensitive! myVariable is different from myvariable.\n\n\n# Assigning a number to a variable\nmy_number &lt;- 42\n\n# Assigning text (a character string)\nmy_text &lt;- \"Hello, R!\"\n\n# Assigning a logical value\nis_active &lt;- TRUE\n\n\n\nData Types: What Kind of Information Are You Handling?\nEvery piece of data in R has a type, which tells R what kind of information it is and how it can be used. Understanding data types is fundamental for performing correct operations.\n\nNumeric: For numbers (integers like 5 or decimals like 3.14).\nCharacter: For text, enclosed in single or double quotes (\"hello\", 'world').\nLogical: For boolean values, either TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n# Numeric examples\nage &lt;- 30\npi_value &lt;- 3.14159\n\n# Character examples\nname &lt;- \"Alice\"\nmessage &lt;- 'Welcome to R programming.'\n\n# Logical examples\nis_raining &lt;- FALSE\nhas_data &lt;- TRUE\n\n# You can check the type with the class() function\nclass(age)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(name)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors: The Building Blocks of R\nVectors are the most basic data structure in R. They are ordered collections of elements of the same data type. You create vectors using the c() function, which stands for “combine” or “concatenate”.\n\nAll elements in a vector must be of the same type (numeric, character, or logical).\nVectors can be of any length, from a single element to thousands.\n\n\n# A numeric vector\nages &lt;- c(25, 30, 35, 40)\n\n# A character vector\nnames &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\")\n\n# A logical vector\nresults &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)\n\n# Accessing elements in a vector (R uses 1-based indexing!)\nages[1] # Returns 25\n\n[1] 25\n\nnames[3] # Returns \"Charlie\"\n\n[1] \"Charlie\""

    "text": "R Code Structure: How R Organizes Instructions\nBeyond individual syntax elements, understanding how R structures sequences of instructions is key to writing functional scripts.\n\nFunctions: Performing Actions\nFunctions are pre-defined blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take inputs (called arguments) and often return an output. You call a function by writing its name followed by parentheses, inside which you pass any required arguments.\n\nCommon functions include print(), sum(), mean(), sqrt().\nArguments are passed inside the parentheses, separated by commas.\n\n\n# Using the print() function to display output\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, world!\"\n\n# Using the sum() function on a vector\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ntotal &lt;- sum(numbers)\nprint(total) # Output: 15\n\n[1] 15\n\n# Using the mean() function\naverage &lt;- mean(numbers)\nprint(average) # Output: 3\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nOperators: Doing Math and Comparisons\nOperators are special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. R has a rich set of operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.\n\nArithmetic: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ or ** (exponentiation), %% (modulo – remainder), %/% (integer division).\nRelational (Comparison): == (equal to), != (not equal to), &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), &lt;= (less than or equal to), &gt;= (greater than or equal to).

    "text": "Common R Syntax Pitfalls for Beginners\nEven experienced programmers make syntax errors. Here are a few common ones to watch out for as you learn R code structure:\n\nCase Sensitivity: Remember, variable is not the same as Variable. This applies to function names too!\nMissing Parentheses or Brackets: A common oversight, especially with nested functions or vector indexing. R will often tell you it”s expecting something.\nIncorrect Assignment vs. Equality: Using = when you mean == (or vice versa) can lead to unexpected results or errors.\nQuotation Marks: For character strings, always use matching single or double quotes (e.g., \"text\" or 'text', not \"text').\nObject Not Found: This usually means you”ve misspelled a variable name, forgotten to assign a value, or haven”t loaded a necessary package."

    "text": "What Are Variables in R?\nAt its core, a variable in R is a symbolic name that refers to a value. This value could be a single number, a piece of text, a logical true/false statement, or even a complex data structure like a dataset. When you assign a value to a variable, R stores that value in memory and associates it with the name you”ve chosen.\nWhy are they so important? Variables allow you to reuse data without retyping it, make your code dynamic (data can change without changing the code itself), and greatly improve the readability of your scripts. Instead of a “magic number,” you can have a variable named \"tax_rate\"."

    "section": "The Primary Assignment Operator: <-",
    "text": "The Primary Assignment Operator: &lt;-\nIn R, the most common and recommended way to assign a value to a variable is by using the assignment operator &lt;-. This operator is often referred to as the “gets” operator because you can read it as “variable gets value.” The value on the right-hand side is “assigned to” or “gets” stored in the variable on the left-hand side.\n\nBasic Assignment with &lt;-\nLet”s start with a simple example. We”ll assign the number 10 to a variable named my_number.\n\nmy_number &lt;- 10\nprint(my_number)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nWhen you run this code, R creates a variable called my_number and stores the value 10 inside it. The print() function then displays the value of that variable.\n\n\nAssigning Different Data Types\nR is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don”t need to declare the data type of a variable before assigning a value. R automatically infers the type based on the value you assign. You can assign various types of data to variables using &lt;-:\n\nNumeric: For numbers (integers, decimals).\nCharacter: For text (strings).\nLogical: For TRUE/FALSE values.\n\n\n# Assigning a numeric value (decimal)\nprice &lt;- 29.99\nprint(price)\n\n[1] 29.99\n\n# Assigning a character (string) value\nproduct_name &lt;- \"R Programming Guide\"\nprint(product_name)\n\n[1] \"R Programming Guide\"\n\n# Assigning a logical (boolean) value\nis_available &lt;- TRUE\nprint(is_available)\n\n[1] TRUE"

    "text": "Naming Conventions for Variables\nChoosing good names for your variables is just as important as knowing how to assign them. Clear, descriptive names make your code much more understandable for yourself and others. Here are some key guidelines for naming variables in R:\n\nStart with a letter or a dot: Variable names cannot start with a number. If they start with a dot, the next character must be a letter.\nNo spaces: Use underscores (_) or periods (.) to separate words, or use camel case.\nNo special characters: Avoid symbols like @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, +, =, ~, !.\nBe descriptive: total_sales is much better than ts.\nBe consistent: If you use snake_case (e.g., my_variable), stick to it throughout your project. Other common styles include camelCase (e.g., myVariable) and dot.case (e.g., my.variable).\nAvoid reserved words: Don”t use names that R already uses, such as if, else, for, function, TRUE, FALSE, NA, NULL.\n\n\n# Good variable names\nuser_age &lt;- 30\nfirst.name &lt;- \"Alice\"\ntotalRevenue &lt;- 1500.75\n\n# Bad variable names (will cause errors or confusion)\n1st_quarter &lt;- 100 # Starts with a number\nmy variable &lt;- \"data\" # Contains a space\nsum &lt;- 5 # \"sum\" is a built-in function"

The dataset includes 15 variables describing key financial and categorical features of each film. Four variables are numeric, providing information such as production budget (in millions of dollars), domestic and foreign box office revenue, and worldwide gross. The remaining variables are categorical and describe aspects such as film genre, lead studio, and release year. Initial inspection shows considerable variation in budgets and earnings across films, and several missing values in variables such as Budget, ForeignGross, and Profitability. These data offer a useful basis for examining factors associated with box office performance.\n\n\n\n\nSummary statistics\n\nsummary() produces quick descriptive statistics for each variable.\nFor numeric variables, it shows the minimum, maximum, median, mean, and quartiles.\nFor categorical variables, it shows frequency counts for each category.\nUseful for a fast overview of the dataset.\n\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie            LeadStudio        RottenTomatoes  AudienceScore  \n Length:1295        Length:1295        Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :10.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:33.00   1st Qu.:49.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :61.00   Median :64.00  \n                                       Mean   :57.58   Mean   :62.18  \n                                       3rd Qu.:84.00   3rd Qu.:77.00  \n                                       Max.   :99.00   Max.   :99.00  \n                                       NA's   :6                      \n    Genre           TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend    BOAvgOpenWeekend\n Length:1295        Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020   Min.   :   204  \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845   1st Qu.:  3482  \n Mode  :character   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600   Median :  6586  \n                    Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541   Mean   : 13400  \n                    3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810   3rd Qu.: 14534  \n                    Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700   Max.   :240000  \n                                                                       \n     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross       ForeignGross    \n Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74   Min.   :  -0.76  \n 1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09   1st Qu.:   3.91  \n Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37   Median :  21.58  \n Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01   Mean   :  88.84  \n 3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38   3rd Qu.:  89.75  \n Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22   Max.   :1369.54  \n NA's   :239                                                          \n Profitability       OpenProfit           Year     \n Min.   :    2.3   Min.   :   0.05   Min.   :2012  \n 1st Qu.:  139.1   1st Qu.:  12.87   1st Qu.:2013  \n Median :  268.9   Median :  31.77   Median :2015  \n Mean   :  435.7   Mean   :  64.50   Mean   :2015  \n 3rd Qu.:  483.0   3rd Qu.:  62.59   3rd Qu.:2017  \n Max.   :10176.0   Max.   :3373.00   Max.   :2018  \n NA's   :239       NA's   :239                     \n\n\nYou probably will not understand every part of the summary output yet, and that is completely fine. For now, focus on the minimum, maximum, mean, and the general spread of the numeric variables.\nFor the categorical variables, the output is not very informative at the moment. These variables are stored as character data, but we can tell R to treat them as factors, which makes their behaviour clearer in later analysis.\n\n\nConvert selected variables to factors\n\nWhat does factor() do?\nfactor() is a function in R that turns a variable into a factor, which is R’s way of storing categorical data (groups, labels, categories).\nMany datasets import text categories as \"character\" data.\nUsing factor() tells R that these values represent categories, not free-text.\n\n\nmovies$Genre &lt;- factor(movies$Genre)\nmovies$LeadStudio &lt;- factor(movies$LeadStudio)\nmovies$Year &lt;- factor(movies$Year)\n\nFor example:\n\nmovies$Genre contains labels such as \"Comedy\", \"Drama\", \"Horror\".\n\nfactor(movies$Genre) converts these labels into a categorical variable.\n\nWe use:\nmovies$Genre &lt;- factor(movies$Genre)\nto replace the original column with a factor version of itself.\nThe $ operator\n\nThe $ symbol is used to select a single column from a dataset.\nFor example,\nmovies$Genre means “the Genre column inside the movies dataset”.\n\n\nCheck the updated structure:\n\nAfter converting character variables into factors, the output of summary() becomes much more informative for categorical data.\nInstead of only showing \"Length\", \"Class\", and \"Mode\", R now displays the number of observations in each category (for example, how many films belong to each genre or studio).\nThis is why converting categorical variables to factors is useful: it allows R to treat them properly as categories and summarise them in a meaningful way.\n\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie                             LeadStudio  RottenTomatoes \n Length:1295        Warner Bros.           :136   Min.   : 0.00  \n Class :character   Universal Pictures     :114   1st Qu.:33.00  \n Mode  :character   Lionsgate              :106   Median :61.00  \n                    Twentieth Century Fox  :103   Mean   :57.58  \n                    Paramount Pictures     : 76   3rd Qu.:84.00  \n                    Sony Pictures Releasing: 72   Max.   :99.00  \n                    (Other)                :688   NA's   :6      \n AudienceScore         Genre     TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend   \n Min.   :10.00   Drama    :386   Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020  \n 1st Qu.:49.00   Comedy   :191   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845  \n Median :64.00   Action   :170   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600  \n Mean   :62.18   Adventure:164   Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541  \n 3rd Qu.:77.00   Thriller :155   3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810  \n Max.   :99.00   Horror   : 85   Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700  \n                 (Other)  :144                                     \n BOAvgOpenWeekend     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross     \n Min.   :   204   Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74  \n 1st Qu.:  3482   1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09  \n Median :  6586   Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37  \n Mean   : 13400   Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01  \n 3rd Qu.: 14534   3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38  \n Max.   :240000   Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22  \n                  NA's   :239                                        \n  ForeignGross     Profitability       OpenProfit        Year    \n Min.   :  -0.76   Min.   :    2.3   Min.   :   0.05   2012:169  \n 1st Qu.:   3.91   1st Qu.:  139.1   1st Qu.:  12.87   2013:172  \n Median :  21.58   Median :  268.9   Median :  31.77   2014:197  \n Mean   :  88.84   Mean   :  435.7   Mean   :  64.50   2015:190  \n 3rd Qu.:  89.75   3rd Qu.:  483.0   3rd Qu.:  62.59   2016:196  \n Max.   :1369.54   Max.   :10176.0   Max.   :3373.00   2017:182  \n                   NA's   :239       NA's   :239       2018:189  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read the summary output\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read the summary output\nThe summary() function gives a quick statistical overview of every variable in the dataset. For numeric variables, it shows:\n\nMin. – the smallest value\n1st Qu. – the value below which 25% of the data lie\nMedian – the middle value\nMean – the average\n3rd Qu. – the value below which 75% of the data lie\nMax. – the largest value\nNA’s – how many values are missing\n\nThese numbers help you understand the overall range and spread of each variable. For example,\n Budget ranges from 0.9 to 365 million dollars, and\n RottenTomatoes scores run from 0 to 99.\nFor categorical variables—now stored as factors—such as Genre or LeadStudio, the summary shows the number of observations in each category. This lets us quickly see which genres or studios appear most often in the dataset.\nIt is also helpful to check whether the minimum or maximum values look realistic. For instance, the Profitability variable has a maximum of 10176%, meaning a film supposedly earned more than one hundred times its budget. This is unusually high and suggests there may be some data entry errors that need to be investigated later.\nOverall, summary() provides a useful first look at the structure of the dataset and can help identify potential issues such as unrealistic values or many missing entries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting unusual values\nSometimes it is helpful to look for values that seem unrealistic.\nFrom the summary output, we noticed that Profitability has a maximum value of 10,176%, which suggests a film supposedly earned more than one hundred times its budget. This is extremely unlikely and probably indicates a data entry error.\nTo inspect these cases more closely, we can filter the rows where profitability is greater than 1000%:\n\na &gt; b tests whether a is greater than b. a &lt; b tests whether a is smaller than b. a == b tests whether a is equal to b; notice the double equal sign! You can also use &gt;= or &lt;=\n\n\nmovies[movies$Profitability &gt; 1000, ]\n\n# A tibble: 319 × 15\n   Movie          LeadStudio RottenTomatoes AudienceScore Genre TheatersOpenWeek\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2016: Obama's… Rocky Mou…             26            73 Docu…                1\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 5 Beasts of the… Fox Searc…             86            76 Drama                4\n 6 Chernobyl Dia… Warner Br…             19            29 Horr…             2433\n 7 Chronicle      Twentieth…             85            71 Thri…             2907\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n10 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n# ℹ 309 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: OpeningWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;, BOAvgOpenWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Budget &lt;dbl&gt;, DomesticGross &lt;dbl&gt;, WorldGross &lt;dbl&gt;, ForeignGross &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Profitability &lt;dbl&gt;, OpenProfit &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\nIf we decide that these values are not plausible, we can replace them with NA so they do not distort later analyses:\n\nmovies$Profitability[movies$Profitability &gt; 1000] &lt;- NA\n\n\n\nInspecting the cleaned variable\n\nsummary(movies$Profitability)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Check for impossible or negative values\nIn your dataset, some variables show impossible values:\n\nForeignGross has a minimum of –0.76 million → negative earnings are impossible\nOpeningWeekend has a minimum close to zero (fine), but some extremely large values\nBOAvgOpenWeekend has a maximum of 240,000, which seems unusually high for average per-screen income\n\nWe can inspect suspicious values:\n\nmovies[movies$ForeignGross &lt; 0, ]\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n  Movie           LeadStudio RottenTomatoes AudienceScore Genre TheatersOpenWeek\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 The Christmas … EchoLight…             21            75 Adve…                5\n2 90 Minutes in … The Samue…             24            50 Drama              878\n3 Popstar: Never… Universal…             78            65 Come…             2311\n4 Lowriders       BH Tilt                57            61 Drama              295\n5 Sleight         BH Tilt                77            52 Acti…              565\n6 The Square      Magnolia …             85            70 Drama                4\n# ℹ 9 more variables: OpeningWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;, BOAvgOpenWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Budget &lt;dbl&gt;, DomesticGross &lt;dbl&gt;, WorldGross &lt;dbl&gt;, ForeignGross &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Profitability &lt;dbl&gt;, OpenProfit &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\nThen correct:\n\nmovies$ForeignGross[movies$ForeignGross &lt; 0] &lt;- NA\n\n\n\n3. Explore missing values\nThe summary shows many variables with 239 missing values (Budget, Profitability, OpenProfit).\nAdd a short explanation:\n\nSome films have missing financial information—this is common in movie datasets.\nWe keep missing values as NA and handle them later during analysis using functions such as mean(..., na.rm = TRUE).\n\nYou can also look at a full missing-data overview:\n\ncolSums(is.na(movies))\n\n           Movie       LeadStudio   RottenTomatoes    AudienceScore \n               0                0                6                0 \n           Genre TheatersOpenWeek   OpeningWeekend BOAvgOpenWeekend \n               0                0                0                0 \n          Budget    DomesticGross       WorldGross     ForeignGross \n             239                0                0                6 \n   Profitability       OpenProfit             Year \n             319              239                0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning explaination paragraph\n\n\n\nAfter inspecting the summary output, we noticed that some values were unrealistic, particularly in the Profitabilityvariable, which included cases above 10,000%. Since such values imply a film earned more than one hundred times its budget, they are likely due to data entry errors. We therefore identified all films with Profitability greater than 1000% and replaced these values with NA so they would not distort later analyses. We also checked for other implausible values, such as negative ForeignGross, and handled these similarly. Missing values remain coded as NA, and functions such as mean(), min(), and max() will require the argument na.rm = TRUE to return a numeric result. Re-running summary(movies) now provides a more realistic overview of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter checking for impossible values, correcting clear errors, and converting categorical variables to factors, we now have a cleaner and more reliable dataset. At this stage, the aim is simply to ensure the data make sense before moving on to later analytical tasks.\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie                             LeadStudio  RottenTomatoes \n Length:1295        Warner Bros.           :136   Min.   : 0.00  \n Class :character   Universal Pictures     :114   1st Qu.:33.00  \n Mode  :character   Lionsgate              :106   Median :61.00  \n                    Twentieth Century Fox  :103   Mean   :57.58  \n                    Paramount Pictures     : 76   3rd Qu.:84.00  \n                    Sony Pictures Releasing: 72   Max.   :99.00  \n                    (Other)                :688   NA's   :6      \n AudienceScore         Genre     TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend   \n Min.   :10.00   Drama    :386   Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020  \n 1st Qu.:49.00   Comedy   :191   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845  \n Median :64.00   Action   :170   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600  \n Mean   :62.18   Adventure:164   Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541  \n 3rd Qu.:77.00   Thriller :155   3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810  \n Max.   :99.00   Horror   : 85   Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700  \n                 (Other)  :144                                     \n BOAvgOpenWeekend     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross     \n Min.   :   204   Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74  \n 1st Qu.:  3482   1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09  \n Median :  6586   Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37  \n Mean   : 13400   Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01  \n 3rd Qu.: 14534   3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38  \n Max.   :240000   Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22  \n                  NA's   :239                                        \n  ForeignGross     Profitability     OpenProfit        Year    \n Min.   :   0.00   Min.   :  2.3   Min.   :   0.05   2012:169  \n 1st Qu.:   4.10   1st Qu.:132.0   1st Qu.:  12.87   2013:172  \n Median :  21.74   Median :246.8   Median :  31.77   2014:197  \n Mean   :  89.26   Mean   :302.6   Mean   :  64.50   2015:190  \n 3rd Qu.:  90.19   3rd Qu.:415.3   3rd Qu.:  62.59   2016:196  \n Max.   :1369.54   Max.   :993.3   Max.   :3373.00   2017:182  \n NA's   :6         NA's   :319     NA's   :239       2018:189  \n\n\nThis allows you to confirm:\n\nthe categorical variables now display meaningful counts for each category\nextremely large or impossible values have been removed\nmissing values remain coded as NA (ready to be handled properly in later weeks)\nthe numeric summaries (min, max, mean) now fall within sensible ranges\n\nAt this point, the dataset is in a good condition for basic exploration.\nNow, we have enough information to write a clear introductory paragraph describing the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample writeup\n\n\n\nA dataset containing records for 1295 Hollywood films released between 2012 and 2018 was analysed.

Initial inspection indicated wide variability in budgets and earnings, and some missing values in foreign gross and profitability measures. These data provide a useful foundation for investigating predictors of film success."

For example:\n\nWhich categories are most common?\n\nAre some categories rare?\n\nIs the distribution fairly balanced or dominated by one or two groups?\n\nFor each categorical variable in your report, include either the bar plot or the frequency table (not both) to avoid duplicating information.\n\nYou do not need to include R output in the report; you only need the written description.

    "text": "R Syntax Basics: Your First Steps in Coding\nLet’s dive into the core elements of R syntax that you’ll encounter every day.\n\nComments: The Programmer’s Notes\nComments are lines in your code that R ignores. They are incredibly useful for you and others to understand what your code does, why you made certain choices, or to temporarily disable a line of code.\nIn R, you use the hash symbol # to indicate a comment.\n\nAnything after # on a line is treated as a comment.\n\nComments improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n\n# This is a single-line comment\nx &lt;- 10 # This comment explains what x is\n\n\n\nVariables and Assignment: Storing Your Data\nVariables are like named containers that hold values. You use them to store data (numbers, text, logical values) so you can refer to it and manipulate it later in your script. In R, the primary way to assign a value to a variable is using the assignment operator &lt;- (a less-than sign followed by a hyphen).\n\nYou can also use = for assignment, but &lt;- is generally preferred for clarity and consistency in R.\nVariable names should start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_) or periods (.).\nR is case-sensitive! myVariable is different from myvariable.\n\n\n# Assigning a number to a variable\nmy_number &lt;- 42\n\n# Assigning text (a character string)\nmy_text &lt;- \"Hello, R!\"\n\n# Assigning a logical value\nis_active &lt;- TRUE\n\n\n\nData Types: What Kind of Information Are You Handling?\nEvery piece of data in R has a type, which tells R what kind of information it is and how it can be used. Understanding data types is fundamental for performing correct operations.\n\nNumeric: For numbers (integers like 5 or decimals like 3.14).\nCharacter: For text, enclosed in single or double quotes (\"hello\", 'world').\nLogical: For boolean values, either TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n# Numeric examples\nage &lt;- 30\npi_value &lt;- 3.14159\n\n# Character examples\nname &lt;- \"Alice\"\nmessage &lt;- 'Welcome to R programming.'\n\n# Logical examples\nis_raining &lt;- FALSE\nhas_data &lt;- TRUE\n\n# You can check the type with the class() function\nclass(age)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(name)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\nVectors: The Building Blocks of R\nVectors are the most basic data structure in R. They are ordered collections of elements of the same data type. You create vectors using the c() function, which stands for “combine” or “concatenate”.\n\nAll elements in a vector must be of the same type (numeric, character, or logical).\nVectors can be of any length, from a single element to thousands.\n\n\n# A numeric vector\nages &lt;- c(25, 30, 35, 40)\n\n# A character vector\nnames &lt;- c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\")\n\n# A logical vector\nresults &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)\n\n# Accessing elements in a vector (R uses 1-based indexing!)\nages[1] # Returns 25\n\n[1] 25\n\nnames[3] # Returns \"Charlie\"\n\n[1] \"Charlie\""

    "text": "R Code Structure: How R Organizes Instructions\nBeyond individual syntax elements, understanding how R structures sequences of instructions is key to writing functional scripts.\n\nFunctions: Performing Actions\nFunctions are pre-defined blocks of code that perform a specific task. They take inputs (called arguments) and often return an output. You call a function by writing its name followed by parentheses, inside which you pass any required arguments.\n\nCommon functions include print(), sum(), mean(), sqrt().\nArguments are passed inside the parentheses, separated by commas.\n\n\n# Using the print() function to display output\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, world!\"\n\n# Using the sum() function on a vector\nnumbers &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ntotal &lt;- sum(numbers)\nprint(total) # Output: 15\n\n[1] 15\n\n# Using the mean() function\naverage &lt;- mean(numbers)\nprint(average) # Output: 3\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\n\nOperators: Doing Math and Comparisons\nOperators are special symbols that perform operations on values and variables. R has a rich set of operators for arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.\n\nArithmetic: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ^ or ** (exponentiation), %% (modulo – remainder), %/% (integer division).\nRelational (Comparison): == (equal to), != (not equal to), &lt; (less than), &gt; (greater than), &lt;= (less than or equal to), &gt;= (greater than or equal to). These return logical (TRUE/FALSE) values.\nLogical: & (AND), | (OR), ! (NOT). Used to combine or negate logical conditions.\n\n\n# Arithmetic examples\nresult_add &lt;- 5 + 3\nresult_mult &lt;- 4 * 2\nresult_pow &lt;- 2^3 # 8\n\n# Relational examples\nis_equal &lt;- (10 == 10) # TRUE\nis_greater &lt;- (7 &gt; 12) # FALSE\n\n# Logical examples\ncondition1 &lt;- TRUE\ncondition2 &lt;- FALSE\ncombined_and &lt;- condition1 & condition2 # FALSE\ncombined_or &lt;- condition1 | condition2 # TRUE\nnot_condition1 &lt;- !condition1 # FALSE\n\n\n\nControl Flow: Making Decisions (If/Else)\nControl flow statements allow your code to make decisions or repeat actions based on certain conditions. The most fundamental control flow structure is the if statement, often paired with else.\n\nAn if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is TRUE.\nAn else block provides an alternative action if the if condition is FALSE.\nCode blocks are typically enclosed in curly braces {}.\n\n\nscore &lt;- 75\n\nif (score &gt;= 60) {\n print(\"You passed!\")\n} else {\n print(\"You need to study more.\")\n}\n\n[1] \"You passed!\"\n\n# You can also have \"else if\" for multiple conditions\ngrade &lt;- \"B\"\n\nif (grade == \"A\") {\n print(\"Excellent!\")\n} else if (grade == \"B\") {\n print(\"Good job!\")\n} else {\n print(\"Keep practicing.\")\n}\n\n[1] \"Good job!\""

R will often tell you it”s expecting something.\nIncorrect Assignment vs. Equality: Using = when you mean == (or vice versa) can lead to unexpected results or errors.\nQuotation Marks: For character strings, always use matching single or double quotes (e.g., \"text\" or 'text', not \"text').\nObject Not Found: This usually means you”ve misspelled a variable name, forgotten to assign a value, or haven”t loaded a necessary package."

    "text": "What Are Variables in R?\nAt its core, a variable in R is a symbolic name that refers to a value. This value could be a single number, a piece of text, a logical true/false statement, or even a complex data structure like a dataset. When you assign a value to a variable, R stores that value in memory and associates it with the name you”ve chosen.\nWhy are they so important? Variables allow you to reuse data without retyping it, make your code dynamic (data can change without changing the code itself), and greatly improve the readability of your scripts. Instead of a “magic number,” you can have a variable named \"tax_rate\"."

    "section": "The Primary Assignment Operator: <-",
    "text": "The Primary Assignment Operator: &lt;-\nIn R, the most common and recommended way to assign a value to a variable is by using the assignment operator &lt;-. This operator is often referred to as the “gets” operator because you can read it as “variable gets value.” The value on the right-hand side is “assigned to” or “gets” stored in the variable on the left-hand side.\n\nBasic Assignment with &lt;-\nLet”s start with a simple example. We”ll assign the number 10 to a variable named my_number.\n\nmy_number &lt;- 10\nprint(my_number)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nWhen you run this code, R creates a variable called my_number and stores the value 10 inside it. The print() function then displays the value of that variable.\n\n\nAssigning Different Data Types\nR is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don”t need to declare the data type of a variable before assigning a value. R automatically infers the type based on the value you assign. You can assign various types of data to variables using &lt;-:\n\nNumeric: For numbers (integers, decimals).\nCharacter: For text (strings).\nLogical: For TRUE/FALSE values.\n\n\n# Assigning a numeric value (decimal)\nprice &lt;- 29.99\nprint(price)\n\n[1] 29.99\n\n# Assigning a character (string) value\nproduct_name &lt;- \"R Programming Guide\"\nprint(product_name)\n\n[1] \"R Programming Guide\"\n\n# Assigning a logical (boolean) value\nis_available &lt;- TRUE\nprint(is_available)\n\n[1] TRUE"

    "text": "Naming Conventions for Variables\nChoosing good names for your variables is just as important as knowing how to assign them. Clear, descriptive names make your code much more understandable for yourself and others. Here are some key guidelines for naming variables in R:\n\nStart with a letter or a dot: Variable names cannot start with a number. If they start with a dot, the next character must be a letter.\nNo spaces: Use underscores (_) or periods (.) to separate words, or use camel case.\nNo special characters: Avoid symbols like @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ), -, +, =, ~, !.\nBe descriptive: total_sales is much better than ts.\nBe consistent: If you use snake_case (e.g., my_variable), stick to it throughout your project. Other common styles include camelCase (e.g., myVariable) and dot.case (e.g., my.variable).\nAvoid reserved words: Don”t use names that R already uses, such as if, else, for, function, TRUE, FALSE, NA, NULL.\n\n\n# Good variable names\nuser_age &lt;- 30\nfirst.name &lt;- \"Alice\"\ntotalRevenue &lt;- 1500.75\n\n# Bad variable names (will cause errors or confusion)\n1st_quarter &lt;- 100 # Starts with a number\nmy variable &lt;- \"data\" # Contains a space\nsum &lt;- 5 # \"sum\" is a built-in function"

For example:\nFor example:\n\nSatisfaction_Likert_value might range from 1 to 5, with\n1 = “Very dissatisfied”\n5 = “Very satisfied”\n\nAlthough the values are stored as numbers, they represent ordered categories, not true numeric measurements.\n\n6.1 Frequency table for an ordinal variable\nThis gives the number of students choosing each response.\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Satisfaction_Likert_value)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  Satisfaction_Likert_value     n\n  &lt;ord&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;\n1 1                             6\n2 2                            57\n3 3                            10\n4 4                            65\n5 5                            62\n\n\n\n\n6.2 We can again use relative frequencies:\nWe can also calculate the percentage choosing each category:\n\nfreq_sat &lt;-\n  students |&gt;\n  count(Satisfaction_Likert_value) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    percent = n / sum(n) * 100\n  )\n\nfreq_sat\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  Satisfaction_Likert_value     n percent\n  &lt;ord&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1                             6     3  \n2 2                            57    28.5\n3 3                            10     5  \n4 4                            65    32.5\n5 5                            62    31  \n\n\nThis helps us compare how common each category is.\n\n\n6.3 The Median for an Ordinal Variable\nBecause ordinal categories have an order, we can meaningfully talk about the median.\n\nDefinition:\nThe median is the value for which 50% of observations are lower and 50% are higher.\nIt is the middle value when all observations are lined up in order.\n\nWe can find the median of the satisfaction ratings directly:\n\nmedian(as.numeric(students$Satisfaction_Likert_value))\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\nThe median satisfaction rating is 4.\nThis means that at least half of the students gave a rating of 4 (“Satisfied”) or higher.\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Cumulative percentages and quartiles\nTo find quartiles, we use cumulative percentages.\n\nCumulative percentage\nThe cumulative percentage for a category is the percentage of observations in that category or below it.\n\nWe can calculate cumulative percentages for the satisfaction ratings:\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Satisfaction_Likert_value) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    percent = n / sum(n) * 100,\n    cumulative_percent = cumsum(percent)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  Satisfaction_Likert_value     n percent cumulative_percent\n  &lt;ord&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1                             6     3                  3  \n2 2                            57    28.5               31.5\n3 3                            10     5                 36.5\n4 4                            65    32.5               69  \n5 5                            62    31                100  \n\n\nFrom this table, we can work out the quartiles and the median:\n\nQ1 (first quartile): first category where cumulative % ≥ 25%\nQ2 (median): first category where cumulative % ≥ 50%\nQ3 (third quartile): first category where cumulative % ≥ 75%\n\nUsing the values in the table:\n\n\n\nQuartile\nRule\nLikert value\n\n\n\n\nQ1\ncumulative ≥ 25%\n2\n\n\nQ2 (Median)\ncumulative ≥ 50%\n4\n\n\nQ3\ncumulative ≥ 75%\n5\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nMost students rate their satisfaction at the higher end of the scale, with the majority of responses in categories 4 and 5, and only a small number giving mid-range ratings (category 3).\n\n\nDoes this interpretation sound counter-intuitive?\nLet’s recap: what the data look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikert Value\nCount\nPercent (%)\nCumulative (%)\nQuartile\nRule\n\n\n\n\n1\n6\n3.0\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n2\n57\n28.5\n31.5\nQ1\nFirst cumulative ≥ 25%\n\n\n3\n10\n5.0\n36.5\n\n\n\n\n4\n65\n32.5\n69.0\nQ2 (Median)\nFirst cumulative ≥ 50%\n\n\n5\n62\n31.0\n100.0\nQ3\nFirst cumulative ≥ 75%\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Q3 falls at Likert value 5 because cumulative percentage reaches 75% only when category 5 is included. Even though category 4 has many responses, it is not enough to reach 75% on its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Clarifications when Identifying Quartiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou always choose the first category that meets the threshold\nIf cumulative jumps over the quartile threshold (e.g., from 3% to 31.5%), that category still contains the quartile.\nOvershooting is fine .\nQuartiles do not require the cumulative percentage to equal the threshold — only to be greater than or equal.\nQuartiles depend on cumulative percentages, not on category sizes.\nEven if a category is very large or very small, quartiles are determined only by: ordering of the categories cumulative distribution across them\nQuartiles may repeat categories.\nIt is possible for Q2 and Q3 to be the same category if that category contains both the 50% and 75% thresholds.\nQuartiles do not need to fall in the “middle” category.\nIn skewed ordinal data, quartiles often fall: higher than students expect or both in the same category or in categories with small raw counts This is normal."

Squaring makes all deviations positive, and larger deviations become disproportionately larger.\nThe average squared deviation is called the variance, written \\(s^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance: \\(s^2\\)\n\n\n\nThe variance is defined as the average of the squared deviations from the mean:\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\,n - 1\\,}\n\\] Here,\n\n\\(s^2\\) = sample variance\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\) = sample mean\n\n\\(n\\) = sample size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we divide by \\(n - 1\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numerator\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n\\]\ncontains (n) deviations, but once the mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) is calculated, the deviations are not independent.\nThey must sum to zero, meaning only (n - 1) of them contain unique information.\n\nExample with two values\nSuppose we only have two observations, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).\nThe sum of squared deviations is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{2} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n=\n(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2\n\\]\nThe mean for these two values is:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the deviations:\n\\[\n(x_1 - \\bar{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\bar{x})^2\n=\n\\left( x_1 - \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \\right)^2\n+\n\\left( x_2 - \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} \\right)^2\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 - x_2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2\n\\]\nEven though there are two points, there is effectively one independent piece of information, so we divide by \\(n - 1 = 1\\).\nMore generally, with \\(n\\) data points, we divide by \\(n - 1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the variance in R\nvar() function:\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    variance_overall_mark = var(Overall_mark),\n    variance_IQ = var(IQ)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  variance_overall_mark variance_IQ\n                  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                  97.0        77.2"

Below, we look at:\n\nStudy_hours → wider spread\nSleep_hours → narrower spread\n\nEven before plotting, we can quantify their variability using the mean and standard deviation:\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    mean_study = mean(Study_hours),\n    sd_study   = sd(Study_hours),\n    mean_sleep = mean(Sleep_hours),\n    sd_sleep   = sd(Sleep_hours)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  mean_study sd_study mean_sleep sd_sleep\n       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       5.84     1.79       6.76    0.983\n\n\nThe standard deviation tells us how much values typically vary around the mean.\nStudy hours vary more (SD ≈ 1.8), whereas sleep hours vary less (SD ≈ 1.0).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)   # if not installed: install.packages(\"patchwork\")\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(students, aes(x = Study_hours)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins  = 20,\n    colour = \"white\",\n    fill   = \"steelblue4\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Study hours per day\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Study_hours: Wider spread\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(students, aes(x = Sleep_hours)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins  = 20,\n    colour = \"white\",\n    fill   = \"steelblue4\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Sleep hours per night\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    title = \"Sleep_hours: Narrower spread\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np1 + p2   # displays them side-by-side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n‘Study_hours’ and ‘Sleep_hours’ show very different spreads.\nEven though the averages are not too far apart, Study_hours has a much larger standard deviation, meaning students differ widely in how long they study each day. This gives the histogram a wider base.\nIn contrast, Sleep_hours has a smaller standard deviation, meaning most students sleep roughly similar amounts. The histogram is therefore taller and narrower, because many values cluster close together.\nHistograms are helpful because they let us see these differences in spread, not just calculate them."
