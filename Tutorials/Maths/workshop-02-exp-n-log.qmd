These problems look at exponentials and logs, exploring how they're used to model various real-world phenomena. You'll need a scientific calculator and a graphing tool like [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) or [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

## Calculations

These questions review how exponentials and logarithms are used in calculations and visualisations.

1. Use a scientific calculator to find $2^{12}$ and $e^5$.

2. Use a scientific calculator to find $\log_{2}(512)$, $\log_{10}(1000)$, and $\log_{e}(2.7)$.

3. If $3^x + 19 = 100$, what's $x$?

4. Using [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) or [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator), plot the graphs of $y = e^x$ and $y = \ln(x)$. 

## Modelling

Within humanities and social sciences, our main interest in exponentials and logs is how they can be used to model complicated phenomena.

### Continuous Interest

Given an initial investment $Q$ with an interest rate of $r$, the amount of money at time $t$ can be found as
$$
  P(t) = Q e^{rt}.
$$
This is a type of [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Continuous_compounding).


1. If the initial investment was Â£100, with a continuous interest rate of 1.7% applied daily, how much money would there be after 365 days?

2. Using a tool of your choice, plot $y = P(x)$. What is the meaning of the $y$-intercept?

3. Plot $y = P(x)$ with a **logarithmic** $y$-axis. What's the gradient now?

### Population Growth

Given an initial population size $P_0$, a growth rate $r$ per day, and a maximum feasible population size $K$, the population on day $t$ is [modelled logistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#Logistic_equation) as

$$
  P(t) = \frac{P_0 \cdot K}{P_0 + (K - P_0)e^{-rt}}.
$$

```{r}
#| label: population-growth-model
#| echo: false
P0 <- 10
K <- 500
rate <- 0.5

growth_model <- function(x) {
  (P0*K)/(P0 + (K-P0)*exp(-rate*x))
}
```

1. Plot this model for $P_0 = `r P0`$, $K = `r K`$, and $r = `r rate`$.

2. What is the range of this model for a domain $t\geq0$?

3. What happens if we extend the domain to $t < 0$?

### Sound

You may have heard of [decibel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) as a measure of how 'loud' something is. You may even have seen a chart like the one below that compare different sounds.

Scale ranges from 0dBA to 110dBA, going up in intervals of 10."}

What you might not known though is that decibels are a logarithmic scale, defined by the equation
$$
  d = 10\log\left(\frac{p}{p_{0}}\right).
$$
Here $p$ is the intensity or power of the sound (measured in Watts), $p_0$ is intensity of the faintest audible sound, and $d$ is volume in decibels.


Using this equation with $p_0 = 1$ Watt, create a version of the graphic above that uses power, rather than decibels, to measure the sound.
