A couple of these problems mention R, but no coding is required! They are mostly pen and paper exercises, though a few of them ask you to create plots or look something up online.

## Decibel Sequence

The solution to the decibel problem in last week's workshop used a little snippet of R code, 

```{r}
#| label: decibel-conversions
#| echo: true
10**(seq(from=0, to=110, by=10)/10)
```

In this is R's `seq` function which generates a sequence of values. It takes some starting value `from`, a final value `to`, and a common difference `by`, then uses those to create an arithmetic sequence.

1. How would the sequence `seq(from=0, to=110, by=10)` be defined as $a_n$ mathematically?

2. Code `seq(...)/10` divides this by ten. What's the definition $b_n$ of the divided sequence?

3. Finally, in `10**(...)`, each term is used as a power of ten. What's this final sequence, $c_n$?

## Sequence to Series

A common pitfall is confusing the terms 'sequence' (a list) and 'series' (a sum). For example, the strictly positive integers $a_1 = 1$, $a_2 = 2$, _etc_ are a sequence $a_n = n$. On the other hand their sum, $1 + 2 + \ldots$, is a series.

1. What is $\sum_{n=1}^{10} a_n$?

2. What's the sum of the first $n$ strictly positive integers?

3. After seeing a video online, Charlie is convinced $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n = -\frac{1}{12}$. Justify why this is not true.

## Hui Shi's Stick

Long before the advent of analytical methods for working with infinite series, ancient philosophers wrestled with their seemingly paradoxical nature. For example in the Chinese _Zhuangzi_ (~300 BCE), 

> If from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.

<!-- Zhuangzi, chapter 33 (Legge translation) -->

Lets say that the length of the stick on day $d$ is denoted $L_d$.

1. Find an expression for $L_d$ in terms of $L_{d-1}$ (_i.e._ the day before). 

2. Find an expression for $L_d$ that only depends on $d$.

Charlie argues that our formulation _can't_ be correct because the paradox says to 'take' half the stick away, so any correct formula must involve a subtraction. They present the following answer:
$$
  L_d = 1 - \sum_{n=1}^d \frac{1}{2^n}.
$$

3. Is Charlie's argument correct? How does their answer compare to yours?

## Weird & Wonderful

There are many weird and wonderful sequences and series. A common one you might have heard of is Fibonacci's sequence, defined
$$
  F_n = \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if}~n = 0, \\
    1 & \text{if}~n = 1, \\
    F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} & \text{if}~n \geq 2.
  \end{cases}
$$
This gives 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on; this links into the [Golden Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#Definition).

The _Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences_ (OEIS) tracks this as sequence [A000045](https://oeis.org/A000045) (along with 388839 others) and includes some more mathematical, historical, and usage information.

1. Define a general sequence $a_n$ however you wish, and calculate its first eight terms are.

2. Search those terms in [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) to see if it's a existing, named sequence.

3. Is there a geometric interpretation of the sequence you've found?
