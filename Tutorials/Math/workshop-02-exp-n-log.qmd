These problems look at exponentials and logs, exploring how they're used to model various real-world phenomena. You'll need a scientific calculator and a graphing tool like [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) or [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).

## Calculations

These questions review how exponentials and logarithms are used in calculations and visualisations.

1. Use a scientific calculator to find $2^{12}$ and $e^5$.

On a standard scientific calculator, powers can be found using a button that looks like $\square^{\square}$, where each '$\square$' is an input to fill. Using this, we find $2^{12} = `r 2**12`$.

Powers of $e$ are special though, and often get their own button that looks like $e^{\square}$. Using this, we find $e^5 = `r round(exp(5), 5)`$ (to five decimal places).

2. Use a scientific calculator to find $\log_{2}(512)$, $\log_{10}(1000)$, and $\log_{e}(2.7)$.

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
Remembering that if $a^x = b$, then $x = \log_{a}(b)$, we could maybe reason these out without a calculator. However, the aim here is to get to grips with logs on calculators rather than solving log equations.

The most general log button on a calculator looks like $\log_{\square}(\square)$. Here the first $\square$ is $a$ (the 'base') and the second $\square$ is $b$ (the 'power'). For $a = 2$ and $b = 512$, we get $\log_{2}(512) = `r log(512, base=2)`$. That is, $2^9 = 512$.

Similar to this though is another button: $\log_{\square}$. This is a shortcut for $\log_{10}(\square)$. Using this, we get $\log_{10}(1000) = `r log(1000, base=10)`$. That is, $10^3 = 1000$.

Finally, logs with base $e$ ('natural logs') have a special button, $\ln(\square)$.[^latin_ln] This gives $\ln(2.7) = `r log(2.7)` \approx 1$. This being about one makes sense, since $e \approx 2.7$.
:::

[^latin_ln]: This is an abbreviation of the Latin, _logarithmus naturali_.

:::{.callout-warning}
On older calculators or software, $\log(\square)$ may be used to denote $\log_{e}$ rather than $\log_{10}$. For example, in the R coding language, 

```{r}
log(1000)
```

which doesn't agree with our calculator answer for $\log(1000)$. However,

```{r}
log(2.7)
```

which is the calculator answer for $\ln(2.7)$ though! In this course we will always use $\log$ to mean $\log_{10}$, but if you use external resources it's important to double check which notation is being used.

3. If $3^x + 19 = 100$, what's $x$?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
While this equation looks more intimidating that a linear or quadratic equation, we can approach it in the same way by performing a sequence of operations to both sides of the equality. Subtracting $19$ from both sides gives
$$
  3^x + 19 - 19 = 100 - 19 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 3^x = 81.
$$
Taking $\log_3$ of both sides then leads to
$$
  \log_{3}(3^x) = \log_{3}(81) \quad\Rightarrow\quad x = \log_{3}(81)
$$
since the $\log$ 'undoes' the power. In our calculator, this gives $x = 4$.

We can verify that, since $3^4 = 3\times 3\times 3\times 3 = 9\times 9 = 81$.

4. Using [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator) or [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator), plot the graphs of $y = e^x$ and $y = \ln(x)$. 

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}

The plots that you get should appear similar to the ones below. 

```{r}
#| label: log-exp-plot
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of exp(x) and log(x) on Cartesian axes."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true
base_axes(0, 5) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x){exp(x)}, colour="lightskyblue") +
  stat_function(fun=function(x){log(x)}, colour="darkorange")
```

From this, what are the domain and range of $e^x$ and $\ln(x)$?

## Modelling

Within humanities and social sciences, our main interest in exponentials and logs is how they can be used to model complicated phenomena.

### Continuous Interest

Given an initial investment $Q$ with an interest rate of $r$, the amount of money at time $t$ can be found as
$$
  P(t) = Q e^{rt}.
$$
This is a type of [compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest#Continuous_compounding).


1. If the initial investment was £100, with a continuous interest rate of 1.7% applied daily, how much money would there be after 365 days?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
From the question, $Q = 100$ and $r = 0.017$. Therefore at $t = 365$,
$$
  P(365) = 100 \times e^{0.017 \times 365} = 100e^{6.205}
$$
which is $P = `r round(100*exp(6.205), 3)`$, or £49,521.90 putting the units back in.

2. Using a tool of your choice, plot $y = P(x)$. What is the meaning of the $y$-intercept?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
Given the values of $Q$ and $r$ from the question, the plot should look roughly as follows

```{r}
#| label: continuous-interest
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of P(t) on Cartesian axes."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true
base_axes(-1, 5) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x){100*exp(1.25*x)}, colour="lightskyblue")
```

The $y$-intercept happens when $x = 0$, which gives $P = Qe^{0}$. This simplifies to $P = Q$. In other words, the $y$-intercept is the initial investment.
:::

3. Plot $y = P(x)$ with a **logarithmic** $y$-axis. What's the gradient now?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
This is what's called a log-linear plot, and it should look for these values something like the below.

```{r}
#| label: continuous-interest-log
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of ln(P(t)) on Cartesian axes."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true
base_axes(-1, 5) +
  stat_function(fun=function(x){log(100) + 1.25*x}, colour="lightskyblue") +
  labs(x="x", y="log(y)")
```

Either using $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$ or functionality in our plotting tool, we find that the gradient of this straight line is 1.25, which was $r$ exactly!

### Population Growth

Given an initial population size $P_0$, a growth rate $r$ per day, and a maximum feasible population size $K$, the population on day $t$ is [modelled logistically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth#Logistic_equation) as

$$
  P(t) = \frac{P_0 \cdot K}{P_0 + (K - P_0)e^{-rt}}.
$$

```{r}
#| label: population-growth-model
#| echo: false
P0 <- 10
K <- 500
rate <- 0.5

growth_model <- function(x) {
  (P0*K)/(P0 + (K-P0)*exp(-rate*x))
}
```

1. Plot this model for $P_0 = `r P0`$, $K = `r K`$, and $r = `r rate`$.

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
Given the values from the question, the plot should look roughly as follows

```{r}
#| label: population-growth-plot
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of ln(P(t)) on Cartesian axes."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true

base_axes(0, 20) +
  stat_function(fun=growth_model, colour="lightskyblue") +
  labs(x="t", y="P(t)")
```

In literature, this is sometimes called a 'logistic curve' or a 'J-curve'.
:::
::::

2. What is the range of this model for a domain $t\geq0$?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
Either from the plot, or by exploring different values of $t$ in the model, we can see that the minimum population is $P(t) = 10$ and its maximum is $P = 500$, with a continuous, increasing line between them.

This makes the range $10 \leq P(t) \leq 500$. Generalising this, the range of the model is $P_0 \leq P(t) \leq K$.
:::
::::

3. What happens if we extend the domain to $t < 0$?

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
There's two parts to this question. Practically, if we plot $P(t)$ for $t<0$, we see that the model rapidly decreases as $t$ does. In fact, the new range of the model is $0\leq P(t)\leq K$.

```{r}
#| label: population-growth-plot-negative
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of ln(P(t)) on Cartesian axes."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true

base_axes(-6, 6) +
  stat_function(fun=growth_model, colour="lightskyblue") +
  labs(x="t", y="P(t)")
```

But what does this mean practically? is this modelling the population numbers in the past? In short, no. Models are only accurate on the domain they were defined for, and the logistic population model is only well defined on $t\geq0$.

### Sound

You may have heard of [decibel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) as a measure of how 'loud' something is. You may even have seen a chart like the one below that compare different sounds.

![[Generator Decibel Comparison Chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Generator-decibel-db-comparison_chart.png), Tom Holland (2022), [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en).](img/Generator-decibel-db-comparison_chart.png){width=40% fig-alt="Table measuring different real world sounds in decibels. Scale ranges from 0dBA to 110dBA, going up in intervals of 10."}

What you might not known though is that decibels are a logarithmic scale, defined by the equation
$$
  d = 10\log\left(\frac{p}{p_{0}}\right).
$$
Here $p$ is the intensity or power of the sound (measured in Watts), $p_0$ is intensity of the faintest audible sound, and $d$ is volume in decibels.


Using this equation with $p_0 = 1$ Watt, create a version of the graphic above that uses power, rather than decibels, to measure the sound.

::::{.content-hidden unless-meta=answers}
:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
First off, we need to find an equation for power given a volume in decibels. If $p_0 = 1$, the above simplifies to $d = 10\log(p)$. This is rearranged to $d/10 = \log(p)$ and finally $10^{d/10} = p$.

Now you can work through the twelve conversions either by hand or using a calculator. Later in the course, we'll see how this could be easily done in R.

```{r}
#| label: decibel-conversions
#| echo: true
10**(seq(from=0, to=110, by=10)/10)
```

Whatever your method, you'll find that these are just powers of ten! From here, we can recreate the graphic using the power values.
