#| fig-alt: "Two square panels show identical sets of scattered black dots, with only the red additions being different. The left panel shows a slightly rising red line drawn through the middle of the panel, passing near a few dots but not obviously related to most of them. A red text is below the dots: R-squared = 0.06. The right panel shows many of the dots connected by red lines to form a stick figure of a man resembling the constellation Orion, with the hand on the reader's right raised and holding an object. A red text is below the dots: Rexthor, the Dog-Bearer. A caption is below and spanning both panels: I don't trust linear regressions when it's harder to guess the direction of the correlation from the scatter plot than to find new constellations on it."

## Example of Maths and Plot

Given response $y$ and **single** predictor $x$, this model fits to the equation
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x.
\end{equation}
```

Visually, the line of best fit from linear regression may look like the below.

```{r}
#| label: scatter-plot
#| echo: false
#| out-width: '80%'
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Scatter diagram for the classic 'mtcars' dataset, showing miles per gallon against horsepower. A linear regression of y = 30 - 0.068x is shown."
#| cache: true
scatter_example <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of MPG against Horsepower",
    subtitle = "Looking at 32 cars from 'Motor Trend' magazine (1974).",
    x = "horsepower, x",
    y = "miles per gallon, y",
  ) +
  ylim(0, 35)

# for first example, all point the same

  geom_point(size=4, alpha=0.33, color="blue") +
  geom_smooth(formula=y~x, method="lm", se=FALSE) +
