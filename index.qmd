# Mathematics, Statistics & Data Analysis

Welcome to this foundation-level course designed to support students progressing to degrees in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. Over 16 weeks, we will develop the core skills you need to explore, visualise, and analyse data to answer real-world questions using mathematics and statistics.

You will build confidence in working with quantitative evidence, and gain practical experience using **Excel** and **R** to manipulate, summarise, and interpret data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 Course Overview

-   **Lectures** introduce mathematical, statistical, and data analysis concepts\
-   **Tutorials** provide guided practice, discussion, and group activities\
-   **MathsHub** offers additional supported study (optional)

You’ll engage in regular **formative quizzes** and complete a final **data analysis project**, where you’ll formulate a research question, summarise a dataset, and report your findings clearly using appropriate methods.
