    "text": "Hui Shi‚Äôs Stick\nLong before the advent of analytical methods for working with infinite series, ancient philosophers wrestled with their seemingly paradoxical nature. For example in the Chinese Zhuangzi (~300 BCE),\n\nIf from a stick a foot long you every day take the half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.\n\n\nLets say that the length of the stick on day \\(d\\) is denoted \\(L_d\\).\n\nFind an expression for \\(L_d\\) in terms of \\(L_{d-1}\\) (i.e. the day before).\n\n\nFind an expression for \\(L_d\\) that only depends on \\(d\\).\n\nCharlie argues that our formulation can‚Äôt be correct because the paradox says to ‚Äòtake‚Äô half the stick away, so any correct formula must involve a subtraction. They present the following answer: \\[\n  L_d = 1 - \\sum_{n=1}^d \\frac{1}{2^n}.\n\\]\n\nIs Charlie‚Äôs argument correct? How does their answer compare to yours?"
