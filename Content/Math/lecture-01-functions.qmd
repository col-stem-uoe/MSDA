## Linear Equations

An equation in a variable $x$ is **linear** it has the algebraic form $y = mx + c$, where $m$ is the gradient of the line and $c$ is the $y$-intercept.

```{r}
#| label: linear-plot
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of a straight line that has gradient 2 and intercepts the y-axis at y = 3."
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the line $y = 2x + 3$."
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 2
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){2*x+3}
base_axes + stat_function(fun=equation)
```

A linear equation $mx + c = 0$ only has one **solution**: $x = -\frac{c}{m}$.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
The equation $2x + 3 = 0$ has the solution $x = -\frac{3}{2} = -1.5$.
:::

::: {.notes}

:::

## Quadratic Equations

An equation in a variable $x$ is **quadratic** it has the algebraic form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are some numbers and $a\neq0$.

```{r}
#| label: quadratic-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of a quadratic curve with roots at 2 and -2.5 and intercepts the y-axis at y = -10."
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the line $y = 2x^2 + x - 10$."
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){(x-2)*(2*x+5)}
base_axes + stat_function(fun=equation)
```

A quadratic $ax^2 + bx = 0$ has no, one, or two solutions, given by $x = -\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
The quadratic $y = 2x^2 + x - 10$ has solutions $x = \frac{-1 \pm 9}{4}$. That is, the solution is $x = \frac{8}{4} = 2$ or $x = -\frac{10}{4} = -2.5$.

## Negative Exponents

Raising a variable to a negative power is the same as taking the **reciprocal** of the positive power (_e.g._ $x^{-3} = \frac{1}{x^3}$).

```{r}
#| label: singularity-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of a curve with no roots and a singularity as x = 0."
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the line $y = 3x^{-2}$."
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){3/(x**2)}
base_axes + stat_function(fun=equation) + ylim(0,12)
```

Care is needed with negative exponents because we want to avoid **dividing by zero**.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
The curve $y = 3x^{-2} = \frac{3}{x^2}$ has a **singularity** at $x = 0$, since it is undefined for that value.

## Combined Example

Real graphs are often messier though, with multiple solutions and singularities.

```{r}
#| label: messy-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of a curve with multiple roots and singularities."
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the line $y = \\frac{3(2x+3)(2x^2 + x - 10)}{x^2(5x+1)}$."
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 4
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){(3*(2*x + 3)*(2*x*x + x -10))/((x**2)*(5*x+10))}
base_axes + stat_function(fun=equation, n=10000) + ylim(-20,20)
```

To make it easier to work with these, we turn to a concept called **functions**.

## Function Machines

You might remember the idea of a "function machine" from school.

![[Function machine](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Function_machine2.svg), Bill Bailey (2009), [ðŸ…®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain).](img/Function_machine.png){width=20% fig-alt="Depiction of a function machine as having some input transformed by the machine into an output."}

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
If we define our function machine as $x+1$, then for any input $x$ we put into the machine we will get one more as the output. For example, we might have 'INPUT 3 $\rightarrow \boxed{x+1} \rightarrow$ OUTPUT 4'.
:::

This is a simplified version of our formal **mathematical functions**.

::: {.notes}
Speaker notes go here.
:::

## Example Function

We can take the previous example

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
If we define our function machine as $x+1$, then for any input $x$ we put into the machine we will get one more as the output. For example, we might have 'INPUT 3 $\rightarrow \boxed{x+1} \rightarrow$ OUTPUT 4'.
:::

and formally define this as a mathematical function

\begin{equation}
  f(x) = x+1.
\end{equation}

Here $f(x)$ represents what we get as the function output when we use '$x$' as input. Using this notation we could replace 'INPUT 3 $\rightarrow \boxed{x+1} \rightarrow$ OUTPUT 4' with

\begin{equation}
  f(3) = 3 + 1 = 4.
\end{equation}

## Inputs & Outputs

::: {layout-ncol=2}
<br> We previously looked at quadratics like $y = x^2$. We could define this curve via a function, $y = f(x) = x^2$. From the plot, see how $x$ and be any real number $\mathbb{R}$, but $x^2$ can only be positive numbers $\mathbb{R}^{\geq0}$.

```{r}
#| label: base-quadratic-plot
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of a quadratic curve y = x^2."
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){x*x}
base_axes + stat_function(fun=equation)
```
:::

To specify these, we may then amend our definition to

\begin{equation}
  f(x) = x^2,\ f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{\geq0}.
\end{equation}

Our set of all possible input values are more formally called the **domain** of $f$, and the set of possible outputs is the **range** of $f$.

```

::: {.callout-tip}
In maths, you will often come across equivalent notations that are all shorthand for the same idea.

As an example, the notation $\mathbb{R}\backslash\lbrace0\rbrace$ above means the set of real numbers excluding 0. This could equivalently be written as $\lbrace x\in\mathbb{R}~:~x\neq0 \rbrace$, which as read would be '$x$ in the real numbers such that $x$ is not equal to zero'. Using either is correct!

## Inverses

When functions model real world process, it's useful to know how to reverse them. In the language of function machines, how do we find the input that produced some output?

Mathematically, we want to find the function $f^{-1}$ such that $x = f^{-1}(y)$.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
For simple cases we can do this by eye: $f(x) = x+1$ is "reversed" by the function that subtracts one: $f^{-1}(x) = x - 1$.
:::

It isn't ~~always~~ usually possible to just 'see' what $f^{-1}$ will be though, so for that we need other methods we can use to reliably find the answer.

::: {.callout-warning}
While inverses use the same notation as reciprocals, $f^{-1}$ is not $\frac{1}{f}$. For example $f(x) = x+1$ isn't reversed by $g(x) = \frac{1}{x+1}$.

## Finding the Inverse

:::: {layout-ncol=2}
::: {}
The method for finding the inverse of $f$ is:

1. Write $y = f(x)$,
2. Swap all appearances of $x$ and $y$,
3. Rearrange the subject to $y$ again,
4. Replace the $y$ with $f^{-1}(x)$.
:::

::: {}
```{r}
#| label: plotting-inverses
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| fig-format: svg
#| fig-alt: "Plot of y = 5x - 7 and its inverse y = x/5 + 7/5."
#| fig-width: 2.5
#| fig-height: 2.5
#| cache: true

equation = function(x){5*x - 7}
inverse  = function(x){x/5 + 7/5}

  stat_function(fun=equation, colour="lightskyblue") +
  stat_function(fun=inverse, colour="darkorange") +
  ylim(-1,5) + xlim(-1,5)
```
:::
::::

This works because the <b style="color:#FF8C00;">inverse</b> is the 'mirror' of the original <b style="color:#87CEFA;">function</b> in the line $y = x$.


::: {.callout-note title=Example}
To find the inverse of $f(x) = 5x - 7$, we first write $y = 5x - 7$. After swapping $x$ and $y$ we have $x = 5x - 7$. Rearranging to make $y$ the subject gives $y = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{7}{5}$, and so $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{7}{5}$.

## Compositions

We can also combine functions. In the language of function machines, this means taking the output of one function and immediately using it as input for another function. 

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
Consider the functions $f(x) = x+1$ and $g(x) = 2x$. The **composition** $f\circ{}g$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  f(g(x)) = f(2x) = 2x + 1.
\end{equation}
_i.e._ we took the output of $\boxed{2x}$ and used it as the input of $\boxed{x+1}$.
:::

This introduces '$\circ$' as notation for function compositions. Note that $f\circ{}g \neq g\circ{}f$.

::: {.callout-warning title=Example}
The **composition** $g\circ{}f$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  g(f(x)) = g(x+1) = 2(x + 1) = 2x + 2.
\end{equation}
:::

:::

## Decompositions

Just as compositions combine functions, **decompositions** can break them apart.

::: {.callout-note title=Example}
Consider $(5x+8)^2$. Here the expression '$5x+8$' is nested within another function. We can think of it as the 'inside' function. The outside function is $x^2$.

<!-- Original work by previous teacher, Lillian Hueber -->
![Visual explanation of function composition and decomposition.](img/decompose.png){width=40%}

A possible decomposition of this function would be $f(x) = 5x + 8$, $g(x) = x^2$.
