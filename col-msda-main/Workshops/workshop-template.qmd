## Multiplication

What is $3\times2$?

:::{.callout-tip title=Solution}
We can think of this asking for '3 lots of 2', so
$$
  3\times2 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
$$
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Alternatively we could think of it as '3 added 2 times', so
$$
  3 \times 2 = 3 + 3 = 6.
$$
For this we can see that
$$
  3 \times 2 = 2 \times 3,
$$
which will be true for any number we try. This property of multiplication is called **commutativity**.
