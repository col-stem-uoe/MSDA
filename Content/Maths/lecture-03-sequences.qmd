# Sequences & Series

We have talked about how exponentials can model growth, but in our day to day we don't always encounter growth in this **continuous** way as a curve. Rather, we encounter it in a **discrete** way as a **sequence**.

## Arithmetic

Say I set myself a New Years resolution of reading more. At the moment I read about 3 pages per night, but I have the idea to increase this by two pages every day in January. On the January 1st I'll read 5 pages, on Jan 2nd read 7 pages, on Jan 3rd read 9 pages, and so on. The number of pages I will is a **sequence**:
$$
  5, 7, 9, \ldots.
$$

The $n^{\text{th}}$ term in a sequence is denoted $a_n$, so here $a_1 = 5$, $a_2 = 7$, _etc_. By observation we might be able to see that on the $n^{\text{th}}$ day I will have read $3+2n$ pages, so here $a_n = 3+2n$.

This means that we can work out a given term in the sequence without calculating all the intermediate terms. For example, on January 31st I'll read $a_{31} = 3 + 2\times31 = 65$ pages.

In general, We define the $n^{\text{th}}$ term of an **arithmetic sequence** as $a_n = a_0 + nd$, where $a_0$ is our starting value and $d$ is the difference we move by each term.
:::

So in the reading previous example, $a_0 = 3$ and $d = 2$.

Suppose now I want to find how many pages $S$ I will read in January total. This would be the
$$
  S = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{31}.
$$
We could compute this by hand, but there exists a handy formula
$$
  S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{n} = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}.
$$

:::{.callout-note title="Theorem"}
This sum is called an **arithmetic series** and you may also see this sum denoted using 'sigma' notation
$$
  S_n = \sum_{m=1}^{n} a_m = \frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}.
$$
:::

For my reading goal, that means
$$
  S_{31} = \sum_{n=1}^{31}(3+2n) = \frac{31(5 + 65)}{2} = \frac{31\times70}{2} = 1085.
$$
That's almost the same number of pages as War and Peace, so probably not realistic as resolutions go!

## Geometric

Another context where growth comes up is in savings or interest. Say I put $\text{£}50$ in a savings account with 2\% annual interest. That is, at the end of the year 2\% of the total balance is added extra by the bank. 

At the end of the first year, it will contain $\text{£}50 + 2\%\times\text{£}50 = \text{£}50 + \text{£}1 = \text{£}51$. Next year though, $2\%$ of my balance isn't $\text{£}1$ any more, it's $2\%\times\text{£}51 = \text{£}1.02$.

By remembering that increasing by $2\%$ is the same as multiply by $1 + \frac{2}{100} = 1.02$, we can put To put it back in the language of sequences as
\begin{align*}
  a_0 &= \text{£}50 \\
  a_1 &= \text{£}50 \times 1.02 \\
  a_2 &= (\text{£}50 \times 1.02) \times 1.02 \\
  a_3 &= ((\text{£}50 \times 1.02) \times 1.02) \times 1.02 \\
\end{align*}
or, simplifying using powers, $a_n = \text{£50}\times{1.02}^n$. That means in thirty five years my savings pot will be a whole
$$
  a_{35} = 50\times1.02^{35} = 99.99448.
$$
Well, $\text{£}99.99$ isn't nothing, but it's certainly not a retirement fund.

:::{.callout-note title=Definition}
In general, We define the $n^{\text{th}}$ term of an **geometric sequence** as $a_n = a_0 \times r^n$, where $a_0$ is our starting value and $r$ is the common ratio we increase by each term.
:::

In the previous example, $a_0 = 50$ and $r = 1.02$. Similar to before, we can compute the sum of these terms - the **geometric series**.

:::{.callout-note title="Theorem"}
$$
  S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{n} = \frac{a_0(1-r^n)}{1-r}.
$$
This formula doesn't hold when $r = 1$ since it would require dividing by zero, though in that case the value of $S_n$ can be worked out directly from its definition.
:::

### Exponential Growth

Geometric series with $r > 1$ are often used to model exponential growth. For example, what if $a_0 = 2$, $r = 2$ then the initially small numbers will increase initially slowly but faster and faster:
$$
  2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, \ldots
$$

With each step, the increase is twice as large as the previous step.
