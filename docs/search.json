The dataset includes 15 variables describing key financial and categorical features of each film. Four variables are numeric, providing information such as production budget (in millions of dollars), domestic and foreign box office revenue, and worldwide gross. The remaining variables are categorical and describe aspects such as film genre, lead studio, and release year. Initial inspection shows considerable variation in budgets and earnings across films, and several missing values in variables such as Budget, ForeignGross, and Profitability. These data offer a useful basis for examining factors associated with box office performance.\n\n\n\n\nSummary statistics\n\nsummary() produces quick descriptive statistics for each variable.\nFor numeric variables, it shows the minimum, maximum, median, mean, and quartiles.\nFor categorical variables, it shows frequency counts for each category.\nUseful for a fast overview of the dataset.\n\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie            LeadStudio        RottenTomatoes  AudienceScore  \n Length:1295        Length:1295        Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :10.00  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:33.00   1st Qu.:49.00  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :61.00   Median :64.00  \n                                       Mean   :57.58   Mean   :62.18  \n                                       3rd Qu.:84.00   3rd Qu.:77.00  \n                                       Max.   :99.00   Max.   :99.00  \n                                       NA's   :6                      \n    Genre           TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend    BOAvgOpenWeekend\n Length:1295        Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020   Min.   :   204  \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845   1st Qu.:  3482  \n Mode  :character   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600   Median :  6586  \n                    Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541   Mean   : 13400  \n                    3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810   3rd Qu.: 14534  \n                    Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700   Max.   :240000  \n                                                                       \n     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross       ForeignGross    \n Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74   Min.   :  -0.76  \n 1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09   1st Qu.:   3.91  \n Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37   Median :  21.58  \n Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01   Mean   :  88.84  \n 3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38   3rd Qu.:  89.75  \n Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22   Max.   :1369.54  \n NA's   :239                                                          \n Profitability       OpenProfit           Year     \n Min.   :    2.3   Min.   :   0.05   Min.   :2012  \n 1st Qu.:  139.1   1st Qu.:  12.87   1st Qu.:2013  \n Median :  268.9   Median :  31.77   Median :2015  \n Mean   :  435.7   Mean   :  64.50   Mean   :2015  \n 3rd Qu.:  483.0   3rd Qu.:  62.59   3rd Qu.:2017  \n Max.   :10176.0   Max.   :3373.00   Max.   :2018  \n NA's   :239       NA's   :239                     \n\n\nYou probably will not understand every part of the summary output yet, and that is completely fine. For now, focus on the minimum, maximum, mean, and the general spread of the numeric variables.\nFor the categorical variables, the output is not very informative at the moment. These variables are stored as character data, but we can tell R to treat them as factors, which makes their behaviour clearer in later analysis.\n\n\nConvert selected variables to factors\n\nWhat does factor() do?\nfactor() is a function in R that turns a variable into a factor, which is R’s way of storing categorical data (groups, labels, categories).\nMany datasets import text categories as \"character\" data.\nUsing factor() tells R that these values represent categories, not free-text.\n\n\nmovies$Genre &lt;- factor(movies$Genre)\nmovies$LeadStudio &lt;- factor(movies$LeadStudio)\nmovies$Year &lt;- factor(movies$Year)\n\nFor example:\n\nmovies$Genre contains labels such as \"Comedy\", \"Drama\", \"Horror\".\n\nfactor(movies$Genre) converts these labels into a categorical variable.\n\nWe use:\nmovies$Genre &lt;- factor(movies$Genre)\nto replace the original column with a factor version of itself.\nThe $ operator\n\nThe $ symbol is used to select a single column from a dataset.\nFor example,\nmovies$Genre means “the Genre column inside the movies dataset”.\n\n\nCheck the updated structure:\n\nAfter converting character variables into factors, the output of summary() becomes much more informative for categorical data.\nInstead of only showing \"Length\", \"Class\", and \"Mode\", R now displays the number of observations in each category (for example, how many films belong to each genre or studio).\nThis is why converting categorical variables to factors is useful: it allows R to treat them properly as categories and summarise them in a meaningful way.\n\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie                             LeadStudio  RottenTomatoes \n Length:1295        Warner Bros.           :136   Min.   : 0.00  \n Class :character   Universal Pictures     :114   1st Qu.:33.00  \n Mode  :character   Lionsgate              :106   Median :61.00  \n                    Twentieth Century Fox  :103   Mean   :57.58  \n                    Paramount Pictures     : 76   3rd Qu.:84.00  \n                    Sony Pictures Releasing: 72   Max.   :99.00  \n                    (Other)                :688   NA's   :6      \n AudienceScore         Genre     TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend   \n Min.   :10.00   Drama    :386   Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020  \n 1st Qu.:49.00   Comedy   :191   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845  \n Median :64.00   Action   :170   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600  \n Mean   :62.18   Adventure:164   Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541  \n 3rd Qu.:77.00   Thriller :155   3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810  \n Max.   :99.00   Horror   : 85   Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700  \n                 (Other)  :144                                     \n BOAvgOpenWeekend     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross     \n Min.   :   204   Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74  \n 1st Qu.:  3482   1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09  \n Median :  6586   Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37  \n Mean   : 13400   Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01  \n 3rd Qu.: 14534   3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38  \n Max.   :240000   Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22  \n                  NA's   :239                                        \n  ForeignGross     Profitability       OpenProfit        Year    \n Min.   :  -0.76   Min.   :    2.3   Min.   :   0.05   2012:169  \n 1st Qu.:   3.91   1st Qu.:  139.1   1st Qu.:  12.87   2013:172  \n Median :  21.58   Median :  268.9   Median :  31.77   2014:197  \n Mean   :  88.84   Mean   :  435.7   Mean   :  64.50   2015:190  \n 3rd Qu.:  89.75   3rd Qu.:  483.0   3rd Qu.:  62.59   2016:196  \n Max.   :1369.54   Max.   :10176.0   Max.   :3373.00   2017:182  \n                   NA's   :239       NA's   :239       2018:189  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read the summary output\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to read the summary output\nThe summary() function gives a quick statistical overview of every variable in the dataset. For numeric variables, it shows:\n\nMin. – the smallest value\n1st Qu. – the value below which 25% of the data lie\nMedian – the middle value\nMean – the average\n3rd Qu. – the value below which 75% of the data lie\nMax. – the largest value\nNA’s – how many values are missing\n\nThese numbers help you understand the overall range and spread of each variable. For example,\n Budget ranges from 0.9 to 365 million dollars, and\n RottenTomatoes scores run from 0 to 99.\nFor categorical variables—now stored as factors—such as Genre or LeadStudio, the summary shows the number of observations in each category. This lets us quickly see which genres or studios appear most often in the dataset.\nIt is also helpful to check whether the minimum or maximum values look realistic. For instance, the Profitability variable has a maximum of 10176%, meaning a film supposedly earned more than one hundred times its budget. This is unusually high and suggests there may be some data entry errors that need to be investigated later.\nOverall, summary() provides a useful first look at the structure of the dataset and can help identify potential issues such as unrealistic values or many missing entries.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting unusual values\nSometimes it is helpful to look for values that seem unrealistic.\nFrom the summary output, we noticed that Profitability has a maximum value of 10,176%, which suggests a film supposedly earned more than one hundred times its budget. This is extremely unlikely and probably indicates a data entry error.\nTo inspect these cases more closely, we can filter the rows where profitability is greater than 1000%:\n\na &gt; b tests whether a is greater than b. a &lt; b tests whether a is smaller than b. a == b tests whether a is equal to b; notice the double equal sign! You can also use &gt;= or &lt;=\n\n\nmovies[movies$Profitability &gt; 1000, ]\n\n# A tibble: 319 × 15\n   Movie          LeadStudio RottenTomatoes AudienceScore Genre TheatersOpenWeek\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;fct&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2016: Obama's… Rocky Mou…             26            73 Docu…                1\n 2 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 4 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 5 Beasts of the… Fox Searc…             86            76 Drama                4\n 6 Chernobyl Dia… Warner Br…             19            29 Horr…             2433\n 7 Chronicle      Twentieth…             85            71 Thri…             2907\n 8 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n 9 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n10 &lt;NA&gt;           &lt;NA&gt;                   NA            NA &lt;NA&gt;                NA\n# ℹ 309 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: OpeningWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;, BOAvgOpenWeekend &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Budget &lt;dbl&gt;, DomesticGross &lt;dbl&gt;, WorldGross &lt;dbl&gt;, ForeignGross &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Profitability &lt;dbl&gt;, OpenProfit &lt;dbl&gt;, Year &lt;fct&gt;\n\n\nIf we decide that these values are not plausible, we can replace them with NA so they do not distort later analyses:\n\nmovies$Profitability[movies$Profitability &gt; 1000] &lt;- NA\n\n\n\nInspecting the cleaned variable\n\nsummary(movies$Profitability)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Since such values imply a film earned more than one hundred times its budget, they are likely due to data entry errors. We therefore identified all films with Profitability greater than 1000% and replaced these values with NA so they would not distort later analyses. We also checked for other implausible values, such as negative ForeignGross, and handled these similarly. Missing values remain coded as NA, and functions such as mean(), min(), and max() will require the argument na.rm = TRUE to return a numeric result. Re-running summary(movies) now provides a more realistic overview of the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter checking for impossible values, correcting clear errors, and converting categorical variables to factors, we now have a cleaner and more reliable dataset. At this stage, the aim is simply to ensure the data make sense before moving on to later analytical tasks.\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    Movie                             LeadStudio  RottenTomatoes \n Length:1295        Warner Bros.           :136   Min.   : 0.00  \n Class :character   Universal Pictures     :114   1st Qu.:33.00  \n Mode  :character   Lionsgate              :106   Median :61.00  \n                    Twentieth Century Fox  :103   Mean   :57.58  \n                    Paramount Pictures     : 76   3rd Qu.:84.00  \n                    Sony Pictures Releasing: 72   Max.   :99.00  \n                    (Other)                :688   NA's   :6      \n AudienceScore         Genre     TheatersOpenWeek OpeningWeekend   \n Min.   :10.00   Drama    :386   Min.   :   1.0   Min.   :  0.020  \n 1st Qu.:49.00   Comedy   :191   1st Qu.: 152.5   1st Qu.:  0.845  \n Median :64.00   Action   :170   Median :2459.0   Median :  7.600  \n Mean   :62.18   Adventure:164   Mean   :2008.0   Mean   : 17.541  \n 3rd Qu.:77.00   Thriller :155   3rd Qu.:3213.5   3rd Qu.: 20.810  \n Max.   :99.00   Horror   : 85   Max.   :4529.0   Max.   :257.700  \n                 (Other)  :144                                     \n BOAvgOpenWeekend     Budget       DomesticGross      WorldGross     \n Min.   :   204   Min.   :  0.90   Min.   :  1.02   Min.   :   0.74  \n 1st Qu.:  3482   1st Qu.: 12.00   1st Qu.:  6.40   1st Qu.:  13.09  \n Median :  6586   Median : 30.00   Median : 26.46   Median :  50.37  \n Mean   : 13400   Mean   : 51.38   Mean   : 58.16   Mean   : 147.01  \n 3rd Qu.: 14534   3rd Qu.: 65.00   3rd Qu.: 66.44   3rd Qu.: 160.38  \n Max.   :240000   Max.   :365.00   Max.   :936.66   Max.   :2068.22  \n                  NA's   :239                                        \n  ForeignGross     Profitability     OpenProfit        Year    \n Min.   :   0.00   Min.   :  2.3   Min.   :   0.05   2012:169  \n 1st Qu.:   4.10   1st Qu.:132.0   1st Qu.:  12.87   2013:172  \n Median :  21.74   Median :246.8   Median :  31.77   2014:197  \n Mean   :  89.26   Mean   :302.6   Mean   :  64.50   2015:190  \n 3rd Qu.:  90.19   3rd Qu.:415.3   3rd Qu.:  62.59   2016:196  \n Max.   :1369.54   Max.   :993.3   Max.   :3373.00   2017:182  \n NA's   :6         NA's   :319     NA's   :239       2018:189  \n\n\nThis allows you to confirm:\n\nthe categorical variables now display meaningful counts for each category\nextremely large or impossible values have been removed\nmissing values remain coded as NA (ready to be handled properly in later weeks)\nthe numeric summaries (min, max, mean) now fall within sensible ranges\n\nAt this point, the dataset is in a good condition for basic exploration.\nNow, we have enough information to write a clear introductory paragraph describing the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample writeup\n\n\n\nA dataset containing records for 1295 Hollywood films released between 2012 and 2018 was analysed.

    "text": "Linear equations and quadratics are two useful ways to algebraically describe the relationship between variables. You might also be familiar with more complicated algebraic expressions for structures like hyperbolae and ellipses, which have forms like \\[\n  \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, \\quad   \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.\n\\] While these specific examples do enable a broader range of modelling, but point to a more general idea for defining algebraic relationships.\n\n\nIn school, the idea of functions is often introduced early on through the concept of a ‘function machine’. This is some imagined box which takes in some number \\(x\\) as an input, carries out some operation \\(f\\) and then returns another number \\(y\\) as output.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematically, this would be denoted \\(f:x \\rightarrow y\\) or \\(y = f(x)\\) which would be read as “\\(y\\) equals \\(f\\) of \\(x\\)” or “the function \\(f\\) applied to \\(x\\)”. As an example of how this might look in practice, the function \\(f(x) = 2x\\) maps values to their double. If \\(x = 7\\) for instance, the output of the function will be \\(f(2) = 14\\).\nFunctions are an important concept in mathematics, and they describe many natural and human-made phenomena. The speed of growth of a plant for instance is a function of (amongst other factors), the temperature of the weather.\n\n\nAside from the relationship between variables, essential to this idea of functions is the set of values that it’s possible to use as inputs or receive as outputs. This is reflected in the full mathematical definition of a function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nA function is a relationship that maps elements from one set \\(A\\) to another set \\(B\\), where each element in \\(A\\) is uniquely associated with an element in \\(B\\). This may be denoted \\(f:A\\rightarrow{}B\\).\n\n\nHere, the first set of values \\(A\\) is called the domain, and can be thought of as the set of valid inputs for \\(f\\). The second set of values \\(B\\) is called the codomain, and can be thought of as the type of numbers we expect to get out of \\(f\\). Linked to that is the range; this is the subset of all codomain values that are actually received as outputs.\nFor example, consider the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) where \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\). This function takes any real number as an input, and returns another real number as the output; its domain is the reals, and the codomain is the reals. However square numbers are always positive, so the range of \\(f\\) is restricted to the positive real numbers.\nSometimes it is easier to think of where a function is not defined, rather than when it is. For instance, the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers (e.g. \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is not a real number). Similarly, dividing by zero is not meaningful, so \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is not defined for \\(x=0\\).\nIn theory (but not always in practice) a function should always have it’s domain specified. For example, strictly speaking we should say:\n\n\n\n\\[\\sqrt{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\geq 0\\rbrace,\\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{x}\\ \\text{for}\\ \\lbrace x \\in \\mathbb{R}~|~x \\ne 0\\rbrace.\\]\n\n\n\nWhile the domain may be restricted because the graph is only defined for certain values, we may also restrict it because in the context of the real-world problem some answers do not make sense. For example, if we wishes to use out function \\(f(x) = x^2\\) to find integer squares we could define its domain as \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), rather than \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nWe are constructing a rabbit enclosure from \\(60 m\\) of fence. With only this fence, we want to make the largest possible rectangular enclosure for our bunny. One side of the enclosure is against the wall so we don’t need any fence on that side.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebraically, we can write that we are aiming to maximize the enclosure’s area \\(L\\times{}W\\) and that our solution must satisfy \\(L + 2W = 60\\). However, since \\(L\\) and \\(W\\) represent lengths of fence in the real world they must also be positive numbers.\nThis is an example of a domain restriction. Any results in our calculations that includes a negative length or area cannot be valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nIn the GeoGebra Applet below, restrict the domain so that the function models the path of the basketball only (i.e. it should not pass beyond the path of the ball).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince functions take one value and map it to another, we can also consider how to take the result back to the original value. Consider the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) over the domain \\(\\lbrace 10, 2, 3, -3\\rbrace\\).\n\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n\\(x^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n10\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n100\n\n\n2\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n4\n\n\n3\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n9\n\n\n-3\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)\n9\n\n\n\nFrom what we know about quadratics, square rooting would be the answer in this case. But in general, are there functions that can map the numbers on the right-hand side of the table back to the left-hand side?\nMost mathematical operations have an inverse operation; addition can be undone by subtraction, and multiplication by division. The same is true of a function, it’s just a case of finding its inverse.\nThe general method1 is to:\n\nwrite \\(f(x)\\) as \\(y\\),\nswap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nrearrange the subject of the formula to \\(y\\) again,\nreplace the \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse operation of the function \\(f(x) = 5x - 7\\).”\n\nFirst we write this as \\(y = 5x - 7\\). Then we swap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to get \\(x = 5y - 7\\). We must now rearrange it to make \\(y\\) the subject, i.e. to put it in the form $y = $ some function of \\(x\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n                            x &= 5y-7 \\\\\n                          x+7 &= 5y \\\\\n                \\frac{x+7}{5} &= y \\\\\n   \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{7}{5} &= y\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFinally, replacing \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) gives that the inverse function of \\(f(x) = 5x-7\\) is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1}{5}x+ \\frac{7}{5}\\). This means that if you send a number into \\(f(x)\\), say \\(10\\)\n\\[\n  f(10) = 5 \\times 10 -7 = 43\n\\]\nand then apply \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) to the result it will return to \\(10\\),\n\\[\n  f^{-1}(43) = \\frac{43+7}{5} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10.\n\\]\nVoila! You can also use Wolfram Alpha to find an inverse by typing in inverse of y=5x-7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 + 7}{5}\\).\n\nWe work through this using “two column working” in the table below.\n\n\n\nEquation\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{3y^2 + 7}{5} = x\\)\nAfter the initial swap.\n\n\n\\(3y^2 + 7 = 5x\\)\nMultiply both sides by \\(5\\).\n\n\n\\(3y^2 = 5x - 7\\)\nSubtract \\(7\\) from both sides.\n\n\n$y^2 = $\nDivide both sides by \\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x - 7}{3}}\\)\nTake the square root on both sides.\n\n\n\nTherefore \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x-7}{3}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we have two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) we can form the composition \\(f(g(x))\\), sometimes denoted \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\)). This is read aloud as “\\(f\\) of \\(g\\) of \\(x\\)”.\nWhen evaluating these we work outwards from the innermost brackets. Here, given a number \\(x\\), we first apply \\(g\\) to \\(x\\) to get the value \\(g(x)\\), and then we apply \\(f\\) to the number \\(g(x)\\) to get the number \\(f(g(x))\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x) = x^2 +1\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x + 3\\), express the composites \\(f(g(x))\\) and \\(g(f(x))\\) explicitly as functions of \\(x\\).\n\nBy definition we have that\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n   f(g(x)) &= f (2x + 3) \\\\\n           &= (2x + 3)^2 + 1 \\\\\n           &= 4x^2 + 12x + 9 + 1 \\\\\n           &= 4x^2 + 12x + 10.\n\\end{align*}\\]\nSimilarly, we have that \\[\\begin{align*}\n   g(f(x)) & = g( x^2 + 1) \\\\\n           &= 2 (x^2 + 1) + 3 \\\\\n           & = 2x^2 + 2 + 3 \\\\\n           &= 2x^2 + 5.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotice these two functions are different functions, e.g. \\(f(g(0)) = 10\\) but \\(g(f(0)) = 5\\). The order is crucial!\n\n\nAt time of writing, Wolfram Alpha does not have function composition capabilities, though the software it is based on does.\n\n\nOther than the idea of a function feeding into another function being a useful one to understand (for instance when you consider machine learning and biological processes), it will also be a useful skill when we come to differentiation.\nFor example, consider \\((\\color{red}{5x+8})^2\\). Here the expression \\(5x+8\\) is nested within another function. We can think of it as the “inside” function. The outside function is \\(x^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if, for example, we were asked to decompose \\(g(f(x)) = (5x+8)^2\\) then a possible answer might be \\(f(x)=5x+8\\) and \\(g(x)=x^2\\)."

But in general, are there functions that can map the numbers on the right-hand side of the table back to the left-hand side?\nMost mathematical operations have an inverse operation; addition can be undone by subtraction, and multiplication by division. The same is true of a function, it’s just a case of finding its inverse.\nThe general method1 is to:\n\nwrite \\(f(x)\\) as \\(y\\),\nswap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nrearrange the subject of the formula to \\(y\\) again,\nreplace the \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse operation of the function \\(f(x) = 5x - 7\\).”\n\nFirst we write this as \\(y = 5x - 7\\). Then we swap all appearances of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to get \\(x = 5y - 7\\). We must now rearrange it to make \\(y\\) the subject, i.e. to put it in the form $y = $ some function of \\(x\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n                            x &= 5y-7 \\\\\n                          x+7 &= 5y \\\\\n                \\frac{x+7}{5} &= y \\\\\n   \\frac{1}{5}x + \\frac{7}{5} &= y\n\\end{align*}\\]\nFinally, replacing \\(y\\) with \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) gives that the inverse function of \\(f(x) = 5x-7\\) is \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{1}{5}x+ \\frac{7}{5}\\). This means that if you send a number into \\(f(x)\\), say \\(10\\)\n\\[\n  f(10) = 5 \\times 10 -7 = 43\n\\]\nand then apply \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) to the result it will return to \\(10\\),\n\\[\n  f^{-1}(43) = \\frac{43+7}{5} = \\frac{50}{5} = 10.\n\\]\nVoila! You can also use Wolfram Alpha to find an inverse by typing in inverse of y=5x-7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nFind the inverse of \\(f(x) = \\frac{3x^2 + 7}{5}\\).\n\nWe work through this using “two column working” in the table below.\n\n\n\nEquation\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{3y^2 + 7}{5} = x\\)\nAfter the initial swap.\n\n\n\\(3y^2 + 7 = 5x\\)\nMultiply both sides by \\(5\\).\n\n\n\\(3y^2 = 5x - 7\\)\nSubtract \\(7\\) from both sides.\n\n\n$y^2 = $\nDivide both sides by \\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x - 7}{3}}\\)\nTake the square root on both sides.\n\n\n\nTherefore \\(f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{5x-7}{3}}\\)."

Here the expression \\(5x+8\\) is nested within another function. We can think of it as the “inside” function. The outside function is \\(x^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if, for example, we were asked to decompose \\(g(f(x)) = (5x+8)^2\\) then a possible answer might be \\(f(x)=5x+8\\) and \\(g(x)=x^2\\)."

If you square root the \\(81\\), \\((\\sqrt{81})\\), you return back to \\(9\\).\nDifferentiation also has it’s “undo” operation, called integration. Sometimes an integral is actually known as the “anti-derivative” because it is in a way the inverse operation to differentiation.\n\n\nThe integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) is a function whose derivative is \\(f(x)\\). So if \\(f'(x)\\) is the derivative of function \\(f(x)\\), then \\(f(x)\\) is the integral of \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotation\n\n\n\nOften the integral is denoted using a capital letter; \\(F(x)\\) is the integral of \\(f(x)\\).

So it must be that \\(\\sin(x)+5\\) is also an integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\). In fact, there are an infinite number of possible integrals!\nTo give us a unique answer, we need to write \\(F(x) = \\sin(x) + C\\) where \\(C\\in\\mathbb{R}\\) is a constant. This “\\(+C\\)” is called a constant of integration and is something we’ll add every time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen differentiating we mentioned that there were a whole bunch of different notations people used. For integration, there’s pretty much just one: \\(\\int~\\text{d}x\\).1 The function that will be integrated, \\(f(x)\\), is called the integrand, and the variable \\(x\\) in the \\(\\text{d}x\\) is the variable we are integrating with respect to.\nThis is put together with the \\(f(x)\\) and \\(F(x)\\) from above to give \\[\n  \\int{f(x)}~\\text{d}x = F(x) + C.\n\\] In Wolfram Alpha the keyword integrate or int is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nTo use Wolfram Alpha to find that \\[\\int{2^{3x}-4 \\cos(6x)~dx} = \\frac{8^x}{\\ln(8)} - \\frac{2}{3} \\sin(6x) + C,\\] we write integrate 2^(3x)-4cos(6x) and get the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nRemember that Wolfram Alpha and some tools like it use ‘\\(\\log\\)’ to mean \\(\\ln\\), rather than log base-10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we differentiated, there was always just one gradient for a given function. However we’ve seen that the same doesn’t hold for integration in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nWhat we’ve seen so far is so-called indefinite integration, \\(\\displaystyle\\int f(x)~\\text{d}x = F(x) + C\\).\n\n\nConsider the interactive graph below. There are three parabolas. You can move the red one up and down by changing the value of \\(c\\). Move the blue point and see how the gradient changes.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that all three parabolas have the same gradient \\(2x\\) where \\(x\\) is the \\(x-\\)coordinate of the point where the gradient is being measured. In other words, given \\(f(x)\\), there’s an infinite number of graphs/functions that have this particular gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo without more information, we cannot know what constant disappeared when we differentiated and should reappear when we integrate. That is why we have to add “\\(+C\\)” at the end of the integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nReturning to the example above, we can write the indefinite integral \\(\\int 2x~\\text{d}x = x^2 + C\\) where the “\\(+C\\)” means that we not know which of the parabolas we need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nGenerally, for \\(f(x) = x^n\\) where \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(F(x) = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} +C\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinite integration, or integration between two limits, returns a specific value rather than a function. Instead of the “\\(+C\\)” we use square brackets and substitute limits into the integral: \\[\n  \\int_b^a f(x)~\\text{d}x = {[F(x)]}^a_b = F(a) - F(b)\n\\]\nYou will not need to know how to write this, but you will need to interpret what the notation represents. The most direct reason that we use this technique is to calculate the area underneath a curve.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light grey area from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = c\\) can be represented by \\[\\int_a^c f(x)~\\text{d}x = [F(x)]^a_c = F(c)-F(a).\\] The blue area is represented by \\[\\int_c^b f(x)~\\text{d}x = [F(x)]_c^b = F(b)-F(c).\\] See how adding these together gives \\(F(b) - F(a)\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nGiven three values \\(a \\leq c \\leq b\\), then the \\[\n  \\int_a^b f(x)~\\text{d}x = \\int_a^c f(x)~\\text{d}x + \\int_c^b f(x)~\\text{d}x.\n\\]\n\n\nIt’s not something we’ll get into much in this course, but this ‘splitting’ can be very useful when the domain contains a point that might cause trouble (e.g. \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) over \\([-1,1]\\), which includes \\(x = 0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph \\(y=6x^2 -9x+7\\) for \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 8\\).\n\nThere are a few different Wolfram Alpha commands that could get us what we want\n\narea under y=6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8,\nintegrate 6x^2 -9x+7, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 8,\nintegrate 6x^2 -9x+7, from 0 to 8.\n\nIt doesn’t matter which we choose, all will return equivalent outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe area underneath the graph is \\(792~\\text{unit}^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nFind the area underneath the graph of \\(y = 5 - x\\) between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 5\\).\n\nIf we use integrate 5-x, 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 5, we get the following output.\n\nWith our understanding so far, this would mean the area underneath the graph is \\(-12.5 \\text{units}^2\\): a negative area! This is because it is below the \\(x\\)-axis. How this is interpreted will depend on the application of the problem.\n\n\nIn some applications, such as design or architecture, the area should never be negative. In others, where the area represents velocity or accumulated profit, then negative area has a legitimate interpretation as growing loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nApplying integration to solve a problem like this is sometimes overkill! This area could have been calculated using the formula of area of a triangle \\(A=\\frac{1}{2}\\text{base}\\times\\text{height}\\). In this case it would have been \\[A = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot{}5\\cdot{}5 = 12.5~\\text{units}^2.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspecially when working with real world problems, we sometimes have additional information about \\(f(x)\\), \\(f'(x)\\), and/or \\(F(x)\\). This information can help find a specific function when integrating, rather than a family of functions connected by a \\(+C\\). This is called an initial value problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(f'(x)=6x+1\\). It is given that \\(f(5)=14\\). Find the expression for \\(f(x)\\).\n\nFirst, find the indefinite integral: \\(f(x) = \\int 6x+1~\\text{d}x = 3x^2 + x + C\\). Then substitute in the initial values to find the value of \\(C\\).\nSince we are told that \\(f(5)=14\\) we need to substitute \\(x=5\\) into the expression and set it equal to \\(14\\). That is \\(3(5)^2 + 5 + C = 14\\) which after simplifying and rearranging gives \\(C = -66\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nThe acceleration of a particle is given by \\(a(t)=8t^3 - 5t +9\\). It is known that the velocity of the initial velocity of the particle is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\). Find the function of the velocity.\n\nWe find that the indefinite integral is \\[\n  v(t) = \\int a(t)~\\text{d}t = \\int 8t^3 - 5t + 9~\\text{d}t = 2t^4 - \\frac{5}{2}t^2 + 9t + C.\n\\] The question tells us that the initial velocity is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\); this means that \\(v(0) = 5\\). Substituting and solving as before, we find that \\(C = 5\\).\nTherefore the function for the velocity is \\(v(t)=2t^4 - \\frac52 t^2 + 9t + 5\\).\n\n\nSo far, we’ve only looked at how to integrate but not really considered why one would want to integrate. Integration is often associated with computing areas like we’ve talked about, but it can also find volumes and other physical quantities too.\nIntegration is also important when solving of differential equations - though that’s a topic beyond the scope of this course. These can be used to model all sorts of real-world phenomena, including population growth, weather, and the motion of planets, so finding solutions is of great practical significance.\n\n\nInitially, we looked at the link between acceleration, velocity and displacement when it came to differentiation. Let’s look at this again using what we now know about integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis speaks to how integration can link these concepts together."

    "text": "Especially when working with real world problems, we sometimes have additional information about \\(f(x)\\), \\(f'(x)\\), and/or \\(F(x)\\). This information can help find a specific function when integrating, rather than a family of functions connected by a \\(+C\\). This is called an initial value problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(f'(x)=6x+1\\). It is given that \\(f(5)=14\\). Find the expression for \\(f(x)\\).\n\nFirst, find the indefinite integral: \\(f(x) = \\int 6x+1~\\text{d}x = 3x^2 + x + C\\). Then substitute in the initial values to find the value of \\(C\\).\nSince we are told that \\(f(5)=14\\) we need to substitute \\(x=5\\) into the expression and set it equal to \\(14\\). That is \\(3(5)^2 + 5 + C = 14\\) which after simplifying and rearranging gives \\(C = -66\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nThe acceleration of a particle is given by \\(a(t)=8t^3 - 5t +9\\). It is known that the velocity of the initial velocity of the particle is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\). Find the function of the velocity.\n\nWe find that the indefinite integral is \\[\n  v(t) = \\int a(t)~\\text{d}t = \\int 8t^3 - 5t + 9~\\text{d}t = 2t^4 - \\frac{5}{2}t^2 + 9t + C.\n\\] The question tells us that the initial velocity is \\(5\\text{m/s}\\); this means that \\(v(0) = 5\\). Substituting and solving as before, we find that \\(C = 5\\).\nTherefore the function for the velocity is \\(v(t)=2t^4 - \\frac52 t^2 + 9t + 5\\).\n\n\nSo far, we’ve only looked at how to integrate but not really considered why one would want to integrate.

    "text": "Probability is perhaps the area of maths closest to statistics, and looking at problems in one often motivates solutions in the other. That’s all a bit abstract though…\n\n\nProbability is the study of chance. Given some event, its probability is a number between zero and one to how likely an event is to happen.\n\nIf the probability is zero, the event is impossible;\nIf the probability is one, the event is certain to happen.\n\nThe higher the probability, the more likely the event is to happen. If the probability is a half for example, the event is just as likely to happen as it is to not happen.\n\n\n\nThe “probability of event \\(A\\)” is usually expressed as \\(\\mathbb{P}(A)\\). The probability of landing on heads if you toss a coin could therefore be expressed as \\(\\mathbb{P}(H)\\), where \\(H\\) stands for “the coin landed on heads”.\nIf the event could have multiple outcomes, say the roll of a dice, then the notation is slightly different. If \\(D\\) rolling a six-sided dice, we say \\(\\mathbb{P}(D = 5)\\) for the probability that the dice lands on a five.\n\n\n\nProbabilities lie between zero and one, but they can be expressed as:\n\nfractions, for instance \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\ndecimals, for instance \\(0.5\\),\npercentages, for instance \\(50\\%\\),\nchances, for instance 1 in 2 chance,\nratios1, for instance 1:1.\n\nThese equivalent expressions are often used interchangeably and can be used for any probability we wish to represent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nFor example, there’s a one in six chance of rolling a five on a fair die. This is usually represented as \\(\\mathbb{P}(D = 5) = \\frac{1}{6}\\), but we could represent this as \\(0.167\\), \\(16.7\\%\\), or \\(1:5\\) odds.\n\n\nIn this course, we usually express probabilities either as an exact value, usually in fraction form, or as a decimal number, rounded either using significant figures or decimal places.\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the theoretical probability of an event, we need to know the sample space \\(\\Omega\\) of an experiment.\nThe sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, the sample space for when we roll a die (the singular of dice) is the set of the six possible outcomes \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\). In this case, all these outcomes are equally likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen each outcome of an experiment is equally likely, the probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes contained within the event by the total number of outcomes of the experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the probablity of rolling a 4?\n\nThere are 4 outcomes in the sample space \\(\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6 \\rbrace\\). The event we wish to find is rolling a four, which is just one of six possible outcomes. So the probability of rolling a six is 1 divided by 6, or \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the probability of rolling a number larger than 3?\n\nTo find the probability of rolling a number larger than 3 consider the number of outcomes that “satisfy” this requirement. The three outcomes are: rolling a \\(4\\), rolling a \\(5\\) or rolling a \\(6\\). There are still \\(6\\) possible outcomes in total and the probability of each is \\(\\frac16\\), so the probability of rolling a number larger than \\(3\\) is given by \\(\\frac36\\), which equals $ $.\n\n\n\n\nSome probabilities like the ones we just looked at can be understood logically, using theory. In other cases, we cannot figure out the probability of an event using logic alone.\nFor example, if we wanted to know the probability that a woman from a particular population will be between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, we need to collect data, i.e. measure the heights of a large number of women in that population to see how many are between 1.65 and 1.66 metres tall, and use this to estimate the probability for the whole population.\nWe call such a probability an experimental probability.\n\n\n\nConsider the graph below. On the horizontal axis, we have the number of times a fair six-sided dice was rolled. On the vertical axis we have value from 1 to 6. The graph represents the average of the results. As the number of times that you roll the die increases, the closer the average comes to the mean average between \\(1\\) and \\(6\\): \\(3.5\\).\n\n\n\n{wallet}\n\n\nThis is called the Law of large numbers. In concrete terms, says that the proportion of the outcomes will approximate their theoretical probabilities as the number of trials increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nIf we throw a dice ten times, it is unlikely2 that all six possible outcomes will be equally represented in the outcome. But if you increase the number of times that you roll the dice, each outcome will be more and more equally represented. Set the number of dice to one and then use this Geogebra page to see how the outcomes even out as you throw the dice more often.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll return to this example in this weeks workshops, looking at how the number of dice impacts the outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some more advanced concepts in probability that we need to cover, but before we can get to those we should probably take a quick detour to properly cover set notation. If this is a concept you’ve seen before, feel free to skip forwards!\n\n\nSets are mathematical objects that are, simply put, collections of elements. The are written with curly brackets. They are similar to lists, but lists are ordered and allow for repetition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSet of objects on the table: {keys, coffee cup, pen, …}\nSet of people in a room: {Joumana, Julie, Alistair, Yotam}\nSet of numbers strictly between one and nine: {x | 1 &lt; x &lt; 9}\n\n\n\nThe concept of a sample space in probability has an equivalent for sets more generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nThe universal set is the set of all objects and depends on the context. The universal set of all socks in the world, or the universal set of all students in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nSets on their own are mathematically interesting, and they can quite quickly lead to complicated ideas.[^You might have heard of Russell’s paradox, the set of sets that contain themselves. However of more interest is how they interact with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefiniion\n\n\n\n\nThe union (denoted \\(\\cup\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in either set.\nThe intersection (denoted \\(\\cap\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in both sets.\nThe difference (denoted \\(\\backslash\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in one set by not the other.\n\n\n\nThis is a way of abstractly defining familiar ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nSay \\(A\\) is the set of odd numbers between 10 and 20: {11,13,15,17,19}.3. Define \\(B\\) as the prime numbers between 0 and 15: {2,3,5,7,11,13}. The union of these two sets is \\(A\\cup B\\) = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}. The intersection of the two sets is: \\(A\\cap B\\) = {11,13}.\n\n\nThese ideas aren’t just limited to numbers thought!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nConsider the set of objects on the table, {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator}, and the set of belongings I need to take with me: {keys, pen, wallet}.\nThe union of the two sets is {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator, wallet}, while the intersection is {keys, pen}. The difference between the objects on the table and those I need to take with me is {wallet} - I wonder where I left it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place sets come up most frequently is in Venn diagrams.\n\n\n\nxkcd.com/773/\n\n\nA Venn diagram is a diagram style that shows the relation between sets, and was invented by English mathematician and logician John Venn in the 1880s. As the diagrams can be used to represent sets we can use them to represent probabilities for combinations of different events. The circles each represent one set. There can be any number of sets[^Though if we want circles, that limits us to three! Beyond that we have to introduce ellipses, sausages, and other squiggly constructs.]. The rectangle around them is the universal set, denoted \\(\\mathfrak{U}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA survey was done on first year students on what they felt made them like some animals more than others. \\(42\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that was fluffy, while \\(28\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that had big teeth. \\(4\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal with both of these characteristics.\nWe can use these data to estimate the probability that a student will favour an animal that is fluffy OR has big teeth, or is fluffy AND has big teeth. Below we see a Venn diagram of the probabilities that a student’s favourite animal will be fluffy, have big teeth, or be fluffy and have big teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this diagram you can see for instance that although \\(28\\%\\) of students seem to prefer animals with big teeth, \\(24\\%\\) students preferred them to have big teeth but NOT be fluffy.\n\n\nWith this squared away, we can return to probability proper and better understand some of its more complicated concepts.\n\n\n\n\nProbability is governed by laws which allow us to understand more complicated questions of chance. If we have more than one event, we need to start thinking about how to combine the events and their probabilities.\n\n\nIn most probability frameworks, whether an event happens is binary: it either happens or it doesn’t happen. From this, we get a probability relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliment Rule\n\n\n\nFor an event \\(A\\), since \\(\\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1\\), \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(A),\n\\] where \\(\\text{not}~A\\) is sometimes shortened to \\(A'\\), \\(\\overline{A}\\), or \\(A^{\\text{c}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: $ ={1,2,3,4,5,6} $. Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\).\nThe event \\(A'\\) is the event that we roll a number that is not greater than \\(2\\) (i.e. rolling a \\(1\\) or a \\(2\\)), so: \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A') = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not greater than}~2) = \\frac{2}{6}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have two events called \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The probabilities for “\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)” happening and “either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) happening are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition Law\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A\\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(B) - \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: \\(\\mathfrak{U} = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\\). Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\), and \\(B\\) rolling an even number.\nThe event \\(A \\cap B\\) is therefore the event that we roll a number that is both even and greater than \\(2\\) (i.e. rolling a \\(4\\) or a \\(6\\)). The event \\(A \\cup B\\) is the event that we roll a number that is either greater than \\(2\\), even or both greater than \\(2\\) and even (i.e. rolling a \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) or \\(6\\)).\nFrom this: - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2~\\text{and even}) =\\frac{2}{6}\\) - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2, \\text{even, or both}) = \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent of one another if the probability that one of the events happens is unaffected by whether or not the other one happens. The events are dependent on one another if they are not independent of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nIn the experiment of rolling two dice, the outcome of each dice is not influenced by the outcome of the other dice. This means that each outcome is independent from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nThe event of me taking my umbrella in the morning is influenced by whether or not it is raining. If it is not raining, the probability that I will take an umbrella is smaller than when it is raining. The two events are therefore not independent, i.e. dependent.\n\n\nIf two events are independent, then we have the following rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Law\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events, \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen at the same time. For example, we cannot roll both an even and an odd number on a single die, and so the events ‘rolling an odd number’ and ‘rolling an even number’ are mutually exclusive.\nWe express the mutual exclusion of two events \\(A\\), \\(B\\) mathematically as \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = 0\\).\n\n\n\nWe are often interested in the probability that event \\(A\\) happens given we know some event \\(B\\) has happened, denoted \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Law\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nConditional probabilities themselves are related through Bayes’ Theorem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened can be expressed as \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(B|A)\\mathbb{P}(A)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nThese are algebraic formulae for working with probabilities, though that’s not the only way to go about it.\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation can be very helpful in understanding probability. We’ve already looked at Venn diagrams so now we’ll turn to trees.\n\n\n\nExample of a tree diagram\n\n\nTree diagrams, also known as probability trees, are particularly useful when there are several events (not necessarily sequential). They are very useful when investigating dependent probabilities.\nNodes (black circles above) represent outcomes or series of outcomes, while edges (the lines between them) represent steps that move from one outcome to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose we a bag containing five counters, of which two are blue and three are red. We randomly choose two counters from the bag, one after the other without replacing the first one in the bag. The possible outcomes are:\n\nchoosing either two red counters,\ntwo blue counters, or\none of each.\n\nIn order to calculate these probabilities it is useful to draw a probability tree. In this, we should consider the possible outcomes of drawing the first counter; and then the outcomes of drawing the second counter (given the counter we picked in our first draw) and the associated probabilities of these different events. ‘Event one’ is drawing the first counter and ‘event two’ is drawing the second counter.\nFor this example we obtain the following probability tree, where the circle on the far left-hand side represents the initial state of the experiment; three red counters and two blue counters in the bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two branches of the tree leaving the initial circle represent the two outcomes of the first part of our experiment, where we pick one counter out of the bag. The event ‘picking a blue counter’ is represented by the top branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), is shown next to the branch (there are two blue counters out of a total of five counters). The event ‘picking a red counter’ is represented by the lower branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), is shown next to this branch. Both branches lead to new circles, which represent the state of the experiment after one counter is drawn from the bag at random.\nEach of the two new states have two branches emerging from them. Each branch represents the outcome of having picked either a blue or a red counter on the second turn, and the probability of each outcome is shown next to the branch. The four circles on the far right-hand side of the tree represent the final states of the experiment.\nUsually a probability tree is simplified, without such explicit drawings of the practical situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach path through the tree represents a unique outcome of the experiment. Each path corresponds to independent events. Hence, the probability of each outcome along a given path is calculated by multiplying together the probabilities on each branch of the given path.\nFor instance, the probability of picking two blue counters is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(BB) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]\nThese events (paths) are mutually exclusive, and so the probability of one or the other happening is found by adding the probabilities corresponding to the individual paths. For instance, the probability of picking a red counter on the second go is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{red on 2nd go}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} =\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]"

They are similar to lists, but lists are ordered and allow for repetition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nSet of objects on the table: {keys, coffee cup, pen, …}\nSet of people in a room: {Joumana, Julie, Alistair, Yotam}\nSet of numbers strictly between one and nine: {x | 1 &lt; x &lt; 9}\n\n\n\nThe concept of a sample space in probability has an equivalent for sets more generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nThe universal set is the set of all objects and depends on the context. The universal set of all socks in the world, or the universal set of all students in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nSets on their own are mathematically interesting, and they can quite quickly lead to complicated ideas.[^You might have heard of Russell’s paradox, the set of sets that contain themselves. However of more interest is how they interact with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefiniion\n\n\n\n\nThe union (denoted \\(\\cup\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in either set.\nThe intersection (denoted \\(\\cap\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in both sets.\nThe difference (denoted \\(\\backslash\\)) of two sets is the set of elements that are in one set by not the other.\n\n\n\nThis is a way of abstractly defining familiar ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nSay \\(A\\) is the set of odd numbers between 10 and 20: {11,13,15,17,19}.3. Define \\(B\\) as the prime numbers between 0 and 15: {2,3,5,7,11,13}. The union of these two sets is \\(A\\cup B\\) = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}. The intersection of the two sets is: \\(A\\cap B\\) = {11,13}.\n\n\nThese ideas aren’t just limited to numbers thought!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nConsider the set of objects on the table, {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator}, and the set of belongings I need to take with me: {keys, pen, wallet}.\nThe union of the two sets is {keys, coffee cup, pen, calculator, wallet}, while the intersection is {keys, pen}. The difference between the objects on the table and those I need to take with me is {wallet} - I wonder where I left it?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe place sets come up most frequently is in Venn diagrams.\n\n\n\nxkcd.com/773/\n\n\nA Venn diagram is a diagram style that shows the relation between sets, and was invented by English mathematician and logician John Venn in the 1880s. As the diagrams can be used to represent sets we can use them to represent probabilities for combinations of different events. The circles each represent one set. There can be any number of sets[^Though if we want circles, that limits us to three! Beyond that we have to introduce ellipses, sausages, and other squiggly constructs.]. The rectangle around them is the universal set, denoted \\(\\mathfrak{U}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nA survey was done on first year students on what they felt made them like some animals more than others. \\(42\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that was fluffy, while \\(28\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal that had big teeth. \\(4\\)% of students responded saying they favoured an animal with both of these characteristics.\nWe can use these data to estimate the probability that a student will favour an animal that is fluffy OR has big teeth, or is fluffy AND has big teeth. Below we see a Venn diagram of the probabilities that a student’s favourite animal will be fluffy, have big teeth, or be fluffy and have big teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this diagram you can see for instance that although \\(28\\%\\) of students seem to prefer animals with big teeth, \\(24\\%\\) students preferred them to have big teeth but NOT be fluffy.\n\n\nWith this squared away, we can return to probability proper and better understand some of its more complicated concepts."

    "text": "Probability is governed by laws which allow us to understand more complicated questions of chance. If we have more than one event, we need to start thinking about how to combine the events and their probabilities.\n\n\nIn most probability frameworks, whether an event happens is binary: it either happens or it doesn’t happen. From this, we get a probability relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliment Rule\n\n\n\nFor an event \\(A\\), since \\(\\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1\\), \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not}~A) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(A),\n\\] where \\(\\text{not}~A\\) is sometimes shortened to \\(A'\\), \\(\\overline{A}\\), or \\(A^{\\text{c}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: $ ={1,2,3,4,5,6} $. Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\).\nThe event \\(A'\\) is the event that we roll a number that is not greater than \\(2\\) (i.e. rolling a \\(1\\) or a \\(2\\)), so: \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A') = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{not greater than}~2) = \\frac{2}{6}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have two events called \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). The probabilities for “\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)” happening and “either \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) happening are related.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddition Law\n\n\n\n\\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A\\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(A) + \\mathbb{P}(B) - \\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose that we roll a six-sided die. The universal set is the set of all possible outcomes: \\(\\mathfrak{U} = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\\). Let \\(A\\) be the event of rolling a number greater than \\(2\\), and \\(B\\) rolling an even number.\nThe event \\(A \\cap B\\) is therefore the event that we roll a number that is both even and greater than \\(2\\) (i.e. rolling a \\(4\\) or a \\(6\\)). The event \\(A \\cup B\\) is the event that we roll a number that is either greater than \\(2\\), even or both greater than \\(2\\) and even (i.e. rolling a \\(2, 3, 4, 5\\) or \\(6\\)).\nFrom this: - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2~\\text{and even}) =\\frac{2}{6}\\) - \\(\\mathbb{P}(A \\cup B) = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{greater than}~2, \\text{even, or both}) = \\frac{5}{6}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo events, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), are independent of one another if the probability that one of the events happens is unaffected by whether or not the other one happens. The events are dependent on one another if they are not independent of each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nIn the experiment of rolling two dice, the outcome of each dice is not influenced by the outcome of the other dice. This means that each outcome is independent from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nThe event of me taking my umbrella in the morning is influenced by whether or not it is raining. If it is not raining, the probability that I will take an umbrella is smaller than when it is raining. The two events are therefore not independent, i.e. dependent.\n\n\nIf two events are independent, then we have the following rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiplication Law\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent events, \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = \\mathbb{P}(A)\\mathbb{P}(B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot both happen at the same time. For example, we cannot roll both an even and an odd number on a single die, and so the events ‘rolling an odd number’ and ‘rolling an even number’ are mutually exclusive.\nWe express the mutual exclusion of two events \\(A\\), \\(B\\) mathematically as \\(\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B) = 0\\).\n\n\n\nWe are often interested in the probability that event \\(A\\) happens given we know some event \\(B\\) has happened, denoted \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional Law\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nConditional probabilities themselves are related through Bayes’ Theorem:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes’ Theorem\n\n\n\nThe probability of \\(A\\) happening given \\(B\\) has happened can be expressed as \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(B|A)\\mathbb{P}(A)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}.\n\\]\n\n\nThese are algebraic formulae for working with probabilities, though that’s not the only way to go about it."

    "text": "Visualisation can be very helpful in understanding probability. We’ve already looked at Venn diagrams so now we’ll turn to trees.\n\n\n\nExample of a tree diagram\n\n\nTree diagrams, also known as probability trees, are particularly useful when there are several events (not necessarily sequential). They are very useful when investigating dependent probabilities.\nNodes (black circles above) represent outcomes or series of outcomes, while edges (the lines between them) represent steps that move from one outcome to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nSuppose we a bag containing five counters, of which two are blue and three are red. We randomly choose two counters from the bag, one after the other without replacing the first one in the bag. The possible outcomes are:\n\nchoosing either two red counters,\ntwo blue counters, or\none of each.\n\nIn order to calculate these probabilities it is useful to draw a probability tree. In this, we should consider the possible outcomes of drawing the first counter; and then the outcomes of drawing the second counter (given the counter we picked in our first draw) and the associated probabilities of these different events. ‘Event one’ is drawing the first counter and ‘event two’ is drawing the second counter.\nFor this example we obtain the following probability tree, where the circle on the far left-hand side represents the initial state of the experiment; three red counters and two blue counters in the bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two branches of the tree leaving the initial circle represent the two outcomes of the first part of our experiment, where we pick one counter out of the bag. The event ‘picking a blue counter’ is represented by the top branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), is shown next to the branch (there are two blue counters out of a total of five counters). The event ‘picking a red counter’ is represented by the lower branch, and the probability of this happening, \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\), is shown next to this branch. Both branches lead to new circles, which represent the state of the experiment after one counter is drawn from the bag at random.\nEach of the two new states have two branches emerging from them. Each branch represents the outcome of having picked either a blue or a red counter on the second turn, and the probability of each outcome is shown next to the branch. The four circles on the far right-hand side of the tree represent the final states of the experiment.\nUsually a probability tree is simplified, without such explicit drawings of the practical situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach path through the tree represents a unique outcome of the experiment. Each path corresponds to independent events. Hence, the probability of each outcome along a given path is calculated by multiplying together the probabilities on each branch of the given path.\nFor instance, the probability of picking two blue counters is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(BB) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{10}.\n\\]\nThese events (paths) are mutually exclusive, and so the probability of one or the other happening is found by adding the probabilities corresponding to the individual paths. For instance, the probability of picking a red counter on the second go is \\[\n  \\mathbb{P}(\\text{red on 2nd go}) = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{2} =\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]"

If \\(a^n = b\\), then we say the \\(n\\)th root of \\(b\\) is \\(a\\), or \\(\\sqrt[n]{b} = a\\) in notation.

This is called the natural logarithm, and is often denoted \\(\\ln{x}\\).\n\n\n\n\nExponentials are very useful for modelling natural phenomena. Imagine you just boiled the kettle and poured cup of tea. As mathematicians are wont to do, simplify the problem by assuming that the water boiled at \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\) and the tea that you poured is still at that temperature. You can imagine that the tea will cool down. Let our independent variable be time \\(t\\) and our dependant variable be temperature \\(T\\).\nCould we model \\(T\\) using a straight line? This would mean that the temperature decreases at a constant rate… eventually freezing… so perhaps not such a good model. How about as a quadratic? Well, the temperature could initially fall until it hits a turning point and then the temperature could increase again… well perhaps not a good model either.\nThe type of graph we need is one that initially represents a rapid decrease of temperature which then gradually slows down. Until … the temperature of the tea balanced out with the surrounding ambient temperature of \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\).1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the graph intersects the \\(y\\)-axis at 100 which represents the starting temperature. It then quickly decreases (because the large difference between the tea’s temperature and the surrounding temperature means that there is a rapid exchange of temperature). As the difference decreases, the rate of cooling also slows and it flattens out at the temperature reaches \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\).\nLook at the equation \\(f(x) = 79e^{0.3x} + 21\\). The ‘\\(+21\\)’ means that the graph will level out as it approaches the horizontal asymptote \\(y = 21\\) because we assumed that the ambient room temperature is \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\). The ‘\\(0.3x\\)’ determines the rate of change. The ‘\\(79\\)’ together with the ‘\\(+21\\)’ gives the initial temperature of \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\). As before, \\(e\\) is Euler’s number.\n\n\nMore generally, the exponential curve looks like in the interactive GeoGebra file below. Change the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to see how they effect the shape of the graph. Consider the following questions:\n\nWhich parameter controls the horizontal asymptote (the horizontal pink line)?\nWhich parameter controls where the graph intersects the y-axis?\nWhich parameter controls how fast the graph increases? (how tight the “bend” is)\n\n\n\n\n\nExponential functions can be written in the form \\(f(x)= a \\cdot b^{cx+d}+h\\) where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\), and \\(h\\) are the parameters and \\(x\\), \\(y\\) are the variables. The horizontal asymptote is given by \\(y = h\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWith \\(b=0\\), a strange graph is produced; that’s because Geogebra is trying to plot something like \\(0^{x}\\) and runs into the issue of \\(0^0\\) being undefined.

In the Geogebra applet below, try changing the parameters in the exponential function to model the total population in Ethiopia.\n\n\n\n\nIt is not that straight-forward! One thing to consider is what the horizontal asymptote could be.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find the intersection point between exponential graphs, or equivalent the solution to equations that involve exponentials. However, this isn’t as simple as it might at first seem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nFind the point of intersection A of \\(y=2^x\\) and \\(y=3^{1-x}+1\\).\n\nSince we’re looking for the point of intersection between the two graphs, we are solving a simultaneous equation where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must satisfy both equations: \\(y=2^x\\) and \\(y=3^{1-x}+1\\). This results in the equation \\(2^x = 3^{1-x}+1\\) which we might think to solve algebraically.\n\n\n\nEquation\nStep\n\n\n\n\n\\(2^x = 3^{1-x}+1\\)\nSetting \\(y\\) values to be equal.\n\n\n\\(2^x = \\frac{3}{3^x} + 1\\)\nUsing the index law for subtraction\n\n\n\\(2^x\\cdot3^x = 3 + 3^x\\)\nMultiplying both sides by \\(3^x\\).\n\n\n\\(6^x = 3 + 3^x\\)\nBy grouping powers and simplifying.\n\n\n\nHowever, at this point it’s unclear how we would proceed. Taking log base-6 will neaten up the left-hand side but make the right-hand side a mess, and vice versa if we take log base-3. It turns out this problem doesn’t have a neat algebraic method for finding its solution.\nInstead, we could find it analytically by looking at the properties of the two curves or geometrically by comparing their plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could find it computationally using methods such as those used by Wolfram Alpha. Using intersection between y=2^x and y=3^(1-x})+1 gives the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of intersection is therefore \\((2,1)\\). The solution of the equation \\(2^x =3^{1-x}+1\\) alone is just the value of \\(x\\). The solution of the equation would therefore be \\(x=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(a^x = b^x\\), what is \\(x\\)?\n\nWe might think that this equation similarly cannot be answered algebraically, but using log laws there is actually a way forward this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation\nStep\n\n\n\n\n\\(a^x = b^x\\)\nOriginal equation.\n\n\n\\(\\log(a^x) = \\log(b^x)\\)\nTaking logs of both sides.\n\n\n\\(x\\log(a) = x\\log(b)\\)\nUsing the log law for powers.\n\n\n\\(x\\log(a) - x\\log(b) = 0\\)\nMoving both non-zero terms to the same side.\n\n\n\\(x\\left(\\log(a) - \\log(b)\\right) = 0\\)\nTaking out a factor of \\(x\\).\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(\\log(a) - \\log(b) = 0\\)\nUsing \\(f\\cdot{}g=0\\) if and only if \\(f=0\\) or \\(g=0\\)\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(\\log(a) = \\log(b)\\)\nRearranging the second situation.\n\n\n\\(x = 0\\) or \\(a = b\\)\nUndoing the log on both sides.\n\n\n\nIn other words, our solutions to this problem are \\(x = 0\\) if \\(a\\neq b\\) or any value of \\(x\\) if \\(a = b\\).\n\n\nTogether, these examples highlight that solving equations that involve exponentials or logs isn’t so straightforward, and that even if it can be solved algebraically there may be different situations in the same problem.\n\n\n\nRemember that graphs can be transformed in four basic ways:\n\nTranslated vertically\nTranslated horizontally\nStretched vertically\nStretched horizontally\n\nLet us consider the graph of any old function \\(y = f(x)\\).

    "text": "In the previous section we looked at how to model growth mathematically, either with exponential functions in a continuous setting or sequences in a discrete setting. It would be useful to have a way to quantify how fast something was growing, and for that we turn to calculus.\n\n\nConsider the following scenario. You are standing on a bridge, holding a stone that you then drop. You might not be able to picture it exactly, but you might have the intuition that although it starts by falling quite slowly, it accelerates and becomes faster and faster in its fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed at which it falls increases because gravity pulls it towards the ground (centre of the mass of earth). Most of the time we consider the strength of the gravitational pull to be a constant, so the speed at which the stone is accelerating in a linear fashion, i.e. the amount that it speeds up is the same every second. This also means that the increasing speed can be modelled by a linear function (straight line with a positive gradient) and the acceleration by a constant function (a horizontal line).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the distance that it travelled down from where you initially held it? This is clearly also increasing. And it is increasing by the speed that it has. So as the speed increases, the rate of that the displacement increases, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are acceleration, velocity, and distance travelled related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the gradient of a straight line is a constant; the very definition of a straight line is that the \\(y\\) value increases in a constant fashion. That’s what makes it linear!\nA quadratic is a function that increases, increasingly; its rate of change increases in a linear fashion.\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence of numbers \\[\n  4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a linear fashion by adding \\(3\\) each time. On the other hand, the sequence \\[\n  2, 6, 13, 23, 36, 52, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a quadratic fashion because it increases first by \\(4\\), then by \\(7\\), then \\(10\\), \\(13\\), \\(16\\), and so on by the linear sequence that we just had before.\nThe gradient (or rate of change) of a quadratic is a linear function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of change of velocity is called acceleration. The rate of change of distance travelled (sometimes called displacement) is called velocity.\n\n\n\n\nCalculus is what we call the study of infinitesimal change. This includes differentiation and integration, both of which we will cover over the next couple of sections.\nThe subject has a really long history and, unfortunately for everyone, there was a historical spat between Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton, two famous scientists of the 17th and 18th century, when calculus was developed.\nThey both invented (or discovered depending on your philosophy) calculus around the same time and came up with different notations. To top it off, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, another scientist from that era invented yet more notation for the same ideas:\n\nLeibniz’ notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}y\\),\nNewton’s notation: \\(\\dot{y}\\),\nLagrange’s notation: \\(y'\\).\n\nAll three are reasonably common, so it’s good to be aware of them.\n\n\nWe considered the gradient of a straight line. Now let us generalise this to other types of functions. The derivative at a certain point is the measurement of how much the function increases or decreases at that point. Consider the graph below. Pay attention to how the gradient decreases and increases, where it is negative and where positive.\n\n\n\n\nIn a weird twist of events, the value of the gradient/derivative can also be considered as a function in its own right and we call that function, the “gradient function” and denote it \\(f'(x)\\).\nLet us consider this: the gradient of a graph can itself be represented by a graph. Consider again the parabola:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the gradient function of the parabola is described by a straight line graph. When the gradient of the parabola at its vertex has the value \\(0\\), its gradient function has the \\(y\\) value \\(0\\) (i.e. it intercepts the x-axis). When the parabola is moving up, the straight line has positive \\(y-\\)coordinates (i.e. it’s above the \\(x-\\)axis. When the graph moves down (the basketball is falling), then the rate of change of its height is negative, so the gradient function is below the \\(x-\\)axis.\nNow we can consider the graph of a cubic and it’s gradient function (derivative). Move the slider to move point A the cubic graph \\(f(x)\\) to see the corresponding value of the gradient/rate of change/derivative at that point and the corresponding \\(y\\) value of the quadratic gradient/derivative function \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the gradient of the line \\(f(x) = x\\) has a gradient of 1 as each time it goes “1 across” is also “goes one up”. Note that the graph of \\(f'(x)\\) is \\(f'(x)=1\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, consider the gradients of the following straight lines. Use the slider to change how steep the lines are and observe the graph and value of \\(f'(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see that the gradient of \\(f(x)=cx\\) is going to be \\(c\\). In fact, you already know this fact if you remember \\(y=mx+c\\) where \\(m\\) stands for the gradient and \\(c\\) stands for the y-intercept, the point on the y-axis where the straight line crosses. Since in our example above this is always at the origin, i.e. \\(c = 0\\), this means that the gradient function \\(f'(x)=m\\) for all \\(f(x)=mx\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a line\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(f(x) = mx+c\\). Then \\(f'(x) = m\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x\\) then \\(f'(x)=5\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=9x\\) then \\(f'(x)=9\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=x+91\\) then \\(f'(x)=1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=-x\\) then \\(f'(x)=-1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x\\) then \\(f'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw that the gradient of a straight line is a constant (that we usually call “\\(m\\)”) and which can be represented by a horizontal line \\(y=m\\). We also argued when talking about acceleration that the gradient of a parabola is given by a straight line (i.e. the gradient increases in a linear manner).\nThis can be generalised further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a general integer power.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) where \\(n\\) is a whole number, then its gradient function \\(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\), a polynomial of degree \\(n-1\\).\n\n\nRecall that \\(x^0 = 1\\) for all values of \\(x\\). From this and the above, we also have that a constant function, \\(f(x) = c\\) for all \\(x\\), the gradient is \\(f'(x) = {(c\\times x^{0})}' = c\\times0x^{-1} = 0\\) for all \\(x\\). In other words, the constant function has no gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x^7\\), what is \\(f'(x)\\)?\n\nBy the above, the gradient of \\(x^7\\) is \\(7x^{7-1} = 7x^6\\). Multiplying this by \\(5\\) gives that \\(f'(x)=35x^6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10\\)?\n\nWe can either apply the above rule to each individual term of the polynomial (e.g. \\({(7x^2)}' = 7\\times2x^{2-1}=14x\\)) or computational software. For example, in Wolfram Alpha using derivative of f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10 returns \\(f'(x) = 20x^4 + 14x - 8\\). So the gradient of a polynomial of degree 5 is a polynomial function of power 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this can be further generalised to include cases where \\(n\\) is not an integer (a whole number, either positive or negative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of arbitrary powers\n\n\n\n\\((x^{a})' = ax^{a-1}\\) for any \\(x&gt;0\\) and any \\(a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(y=5x-\\sqrt{x}\\)?\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}\\), it follows from our rules for powers that \\[\n  {(\\sqrt{x})}' = x^{0.5-1} = x^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{x^{0.5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}.\n\\] Then we have that \\(y'=5-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the derivative of \\(f(x) = 4\\sqrt{x}+ \\frac{7}{x} - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\)?\n\nWe note that this can be written as \\(f(x) = 4x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7x^{-1} - x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Then by applying to above rule to each term, \\[\n  f'(x) = 4\\times\\frac{1}{2} \\times x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - 7x^{-2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\times x^{-\\frac{2}{3}}.\n\\] This can be simplified to \\(f'(x)= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{x}}-\\frac{7}{x^2} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven some function that models the velocity of a aeroplane (or comet’s orbit, a profit curve, etc.), we can find what the velocity is at a certain point of time by substituting a value into the variable. But to know what the acceleration is of the bike, you first need to find the derivative of the function and then substitute the value of the point of time into it.\n\n\nLet the velocity of a particle be described by the function \\(v(t)=4t-t^2\\) where \\(v\\) is the velocity measured in \\(\\text{m/s}\\)and \\(t\\) is the time in seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the initial velocity?\n\nInitial means that \\(t=0\\). So you’re looking for \\(v(0)\\), i.e. the value when substituting \\(t=0\\) into the function of \\(v(t)\\).\nHere, \\(v(0) = 4\\times0-0^2 = 0\\). We can also type v(t)=4t-t^2 where t=0 into Wolfram Alpha. The initial velocity (speed) is zero meaning that that particle is initially not moving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the initial acceleration?\n\nTo find the initial acceleration, \\(a(0)=v'(0)\\), we first find the derivative to see that \\(v'(t)=4-2t\\) and then substitute \\(t=0\\) into this: \\[\n  v'(0) = 4 - 2t = 4 - 2\\cdot0 = 4.\n\\] So the acceleration is \\(4\\text{m/s}^2\\). The particle is being accelerated forward, the velocity is increasing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample C\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the velocity of the particle after one second?\n\nSubstitute \\(t=1\\) into the function of \\(v(t)\\) to obtain \\(v(1)\\). By hand that is \\(v(1) = 4 \\times 1 - (1)^2 = 3 \\text{m/s}\\). Through Wolfram Alpha, this would be 4t-t^2 at t=1. The particle now has a positive velocity, meaning that it is moving forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample D\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the acceleration after two seconds?\n\nSubstitute \\(t=2\\) into the acceleration to obtain \\(a(2)=v'(2)\\). By hand we can do can do \\(v'(2)=4-2 \\times 2 = 0\\). Alternatively, by Wolfram Alpha, find the derivative of v(t)=4t-t^2 at t=2\nAfter two seconds, the acceleration after two seconds is \\(0 m/s^2\\) meaning that it no longer accelerates the particle. This means that the velocity is no longer increasing.\n\n\nPulling all these examples together, here is a graph of the velocity.\n\n\n\nPlot with \\(t\\) on the horizontal axis and \\(v(t)\\) on the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis idea of of the derivative giving the gradient can be extended to other functions that we have looked at so far. Before we look at those however, it will be useful to state some rules that will help us.\n\n\nGiven two functions, \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\), there are several key rules for working out what the derivatives of different combinations of those two functions might be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a composition of two functions, \\(h(x) = f(g(x))\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = f'(g(x))\\times g'(x).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a product of two functions \\(h(x) = f(x)g(x)\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotient Rule\n\n\n\nGiven a ratio of two functions \\(h(x) = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\), then the derivative is given by \\[h'(x) = \\frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the gradient of the sine graph. Again, pay particular attention to the places where the gradient of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is equal to zero.\n\n\n\n\nNotice how there are some places where the gradient is zero. What is special about these places? There are some values where the gradient is positive, and some where it’s negative. And this repeats periodically.\nWhat graph or function do you know that has periodicity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nFor the trig functions:\n\n\\(y = \\sin(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = \\cos(x)\\)\n\\(y = \\cos(x)\\) has the derivative \\(y' = -\\sin(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nGiven that \\(f(x)= 4x + sin(3x)\\), find \\(f'(x)\\).\n\nWe know from the above that the derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(\\cos(x)\\), and the derivative of \\(3x\\) is \\(3\\). Letting \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(g(x) = 3x\\) gives the composition \\(f(g(x)) = \\sin(3x)\\). Then, by the chain rule, the derivative of the composition is\\[\n  f'(g(x))\\times g'(x) = \\cos(3x)\\times 3 = 3\\cos(3x).\n\\] We can also find that by typing in differentiate f(x) = 4x + sin(3x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nThe height of the tide in a harbour can be modelled by the graph \\(H(t)=4.8 \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}(t+3)) + 5.1\\) where \\(H(t)\\) is measured in metres and \\(t\\) is measured in hours after midnight. What is the curve that models the rate of change in the tide?\n\nThe rate of change (i.e. how rapidly the tide comes in and flows out) is given by \\[H'(t)= -2.5132\\times\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}t\\right).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember when we considered Douglas’ coffee cooling down from a fictional \\(100^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\)? Initially, the rate at which is was cooling down was quite rapid. This was because the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air was great.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the difference between the temperature of the coffee and the surrounding air became smaller (decreased), the rate at which the coffee continued to cool down slowed down.\nAs the coffee neared the temperature of the surrounding air, a fictional \\(21^{\\circ}\\text{C}\\), the coffee would stop cooling down as there was now very little difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature.\nConsider the following interactive graph. Move the point A. As time increases, the \\(y\\) “Temperature” value decreases as the temperature of the tea is decreasing. The gradient is therefore negative (you can see the value).\nThe gradient function is represented by the blue graph. You can see that it remains below the \\(x-\\)axis even as it comes closer and closer to the \\(x-\\)axis. This represents the fact that although the tea (or coffee) keeps getting colder (as it approaches the ambient temperature), the rate of decrease becomes more and more smaller.\n\n\n\n\nYou might be able to see that, even if the blue graph is upside down, it has the same general shape as the green graph which represents the temperature of Douglas’ coffee. In fact, the gradient of an exponential function is another exponential function. The rate of change of a quantity that increases or decreases in an exponential fashion is itself exponential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\nLet \\(y=2^x\\). Use the command differentiate y=2^x to obtain the answer: \\(y'=2^x log(2)\\) or if you use the approximate values: \\(y' =0.693147 2^x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(f(x)=18 \\times 9.1x^{3x}+7x\\). Use the command differentiate f(x)=18  9.1^(3x) +7x to obtain \\(f'(x) = 119.247 \\times 9.1^{3x} + 7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about the natural exponential function in a previous week. Part of what makes these particularly important for growth models from biology or economics is the following property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\n\n\nIf \\(y = e^x\\), then \\(y' = e^x\\) also. That is, the natural exponential is a function where the graph of the function and the graph of its gradient are the same.\n\n\nWe can then combine this with the other rules to work out exponential derivatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\nLet \\(h(x)=18 \\times e^{3x}+11\\). This can be differentiated using the chain rule, where \\(f(x) = 18e^x + 11\\) (so \\(f'(x) = 18e^x\\)) and \\(g(x) = 3x\\) (so \\(g'(x) = 3\\)).\nWe get \\[\n  h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 18e^{g(x)}\\times3 = 54e^{3x}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample C\n\n\n\nLet \\(y = 4 - 5e^{\\frac{1}{2}x}\\). Find the value of the gradient of this function when \\(x = 9\\). Use differentiate 4 - 5*exp(-0.5x) at x=9 to obtain -(5 e^(9/2))/2, or the approximate form: \\(-225.043\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization is the process of finding the maximum and/or minimum value of a function. If the function is posed as part of a problem, such a value is often referred to as the optimal solution.\n\n\nWhen we studied parabolas we looked at the maximum or minimum value that the vertical value of a graph could take by finding the vertex (e.g. the height of a thrown basketball). Now we can generalise this because differentiation allows us to find these points for many more graphs.\n\n\n\n\nTo find the maxima (plural of maximum) or minima (plural of minimum) of a graph you need to consider what is happening to the function’s gradient.\nLook again at the graph above. You can see that at the extrema (maxima or minima), the graph “turns around” (one reason we call them turning points also). Either the graph is going down and then back up or it is increasing and then, after the turning point, decreasing again.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese maxima and minima are the points where the gradient is zero, so can be found by solving \\(f'(x) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThink back to our example of acceleration \\(a(t)\\), velocity \\(v(t)\\), and distance \\(d(t)\\). There we talked about how velocity was the rate of change in distance with respect to time, and how acceleration was the change in velocity with respect to time. With this, can we connect acceleration and distance?\nSince \\(v(t) = d'(t)\\) and \\(a(t) = v'(t)\\), we could substitute the first equation into the second to get that \\[\n  a(t) = (v(t))' = (d'(t))'.\n\\] In other words, we define acceleration b as the derivative of the derivative of the distance with respect to time. This is what is called a second derivative.\nIn the various notations discussed earlier these would be:\n\nLeibniz’ notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}^2}{\\text{d}x^2}y\\),\nNewton’s notation: \\(\\ddot{y}\\),\nLagrange’s notation: \\(y''\\).\n\nWe can extend this idea to the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) derivative (i.e. what comes after taking the derivative of a function \\(n\\) times). This is usually denoted by \\(f^{(n)}(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{\\text{d}^{n}y}{\\text{d}x^n}\\) since the other two notations get complicated for \\(n&gt;3\\).\nThe main use of higher derivatives is to find whether given extrema are maxima or minima without having to graph the function. If \\(f''(x) &gt; 0\\), the point at \\(x\\) is a minimum. If \\(f''(x) &lt; 0\\), the point is a maximum."

    "text": "Consider the following scenario. You are standing on a bridge, holding a stone that you then drop. You might not be able to picture it exactly, but you might have the intuition that although it starts by falling quite slowly, it accelerates and becomes faster and faster in its fall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speed at which it falls increases because gravity pulls it towards the ground (centre of the mass of earth). Most of the time we consider the strength of the gravitational pull to be a constant, so the speed at which the stone is accelerating in a linear fashion, i.e. the amount that it speeds up is the same every second. This also means that the increasing speed can be modelled by a linear function (straight line with a positive gradient) and the acceleration by a constant function (a horizontal line).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the distance that it travelled down from where you initially held it? This is clearly also increasing. And it is increasing by the speed that it has. So as the speed increases, the rate of that the displacement increases, increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are acceleration, velocity, and distance travelled related?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the gradient of a straight line is a constant; the very definition of a straight line is that the \\(y\\) value increases in a constant fashion. That’s what makes it linear!\nA quadratic is a function that increases, increasingly; its rate of change increases in a linear fashion.\nSimilarly, the arithmetic sequence of numbers \\[\n  4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a linear fashion by adding \\(3\\) each time. On the other hand, the sequence \\[\n  2, 6, 13, 23, 36, 52, \\ldots\n\\] increases in a quadratic fashion because it increases first by \\(4\\), then by \\(7\\), then \\(10\\), \\(13\\), \\(16\\), and so on by the linear sequence that we just had before.\nThe gradient (or rate of change) of a quadratic is a linear function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of change of velocity is called acceleration.

    "text": "Calculus is what we call the study of infinitesimal change. This includes differentiation and integration, both of which we will cover over the next couple of sections.\nThe subject has a really long history and, unfortunately for everyone, there was a historical spat between Gottfried Leibniz and Isaac Newton, two famous scientists of the 17th and 18th century, when calculus was developed.\nThey both invented (or discovered depending on your philosophy) calculus around the same time and came up with different notations. To top it off, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, another scientist from that era invented yet more notation for the same ideas:\n\nLeibniz’ notation: \\(\\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d}x}y\\),\nNewton’s notation: \\(\\dot{y}\\),\nLagrange’s notation: \\(y'\\).\n\nAll three are reasonably common, so it’s good to be aware of them.\n\n\nWe considered the gradient of a straight line. Now let us generalise this to other types of functions. The derivative at a certain point is the measurement of how much the function increases or decreases at that point. Consider the graph below. Pay attention to how the gradient decreases and increases, where it is negative and where positive.\n\n\n\n\nIn a weird twist of events, the value of the gradient/derivative can also be considered as a function in its own right and we call that function, the “gradient function” and denote it \\(f'(x)\\).\nLet us consider this: the gradient of a graph can itself be represented by a graph. Consider again the parabola:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see how the gradient function of the parabola is described by a straight line graph. When the gradient of the parabola at its vertex has the value \\(0\\), its gradient function has the \\(y\\) value \\(0\\) (i.e. it intercepts the x-axis). When the parabola is moving up, the straight line has positive \\(y-\\)coordinates (i.e. it’s above the \\(x-\\)axis. When the graph moves down (the basketball is falling), then the rate of change of its height is negative, so the gradient function is below the \\(x-\\)axis.\nNow we can consider the graph of a cubic and it’s gradient function (derivative). Move the slider to move point A the cubic graph \\(f(x)\\) to see the corresponding value of the gradient/rate of change/derivative at that point and the corresponding \\(y\\) value of the quadratic gradient/derivative function \\(f'(x)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should be able to see that the gradient of the line \\(f(x) = x\\) has a gradient of 1 as each time it goes “1 across” is also “goes one up”. Note that the graph of \\(f'(x)\\) is \\(f'(x)=1\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, consider the gradients of the following straight lines. Use the slider to change how steep the lines are and observe the graph and value of \\(f'(x)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this you can see that the gradient of \\(f(x)=cx\\) is going to be \\(c\\). In fact, you already know this fact if you remember \\(y=mx+c\\) where \\(m\\) stands for the gradient and \\(c\\) stands for the y-intercept, the point on the y-axis where the straight line crosses. Since in our example above this is always at the origin, i.e. \\(c = 0\\), this means that the gradient function \\(f'(x)=m\\) for all \\(f(x)=mx\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a line\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(f(x) = mx+c\\). Then \\(f'(x) = m\\) for all \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x\\) then \\(f'(x)=5\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=9x\\) then \\(f'(x)=9\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=x+91\\) then \\(f'(x)=1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=-x\\) then \\(f'(x)=-1\\).\nIf \\(f(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x\\) then \\(f'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw that the gradient of a straight line is a constant (that we usually call “\\(m\\)”) and which can be represented by a horizontal line \\(y=m\\). We also argued when talking about acceleration that the gradient of a parabola is given by a straight line (i.e. the gradient increases in a linear manner).\nThis can be generalised further:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of a general integer power.\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a polynomial of degree \\(n\\) where \\(n\\) is a whole number, then its gradient function \\(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\\), a polynomial of degree \\(n-1\\).\n\n\nRecall that \\(x^0 = 1\\) for all values of \\(x\\). From this and the above, we also have that a constant function, \\(f(x) = c\\) for all \\(x\\), the gradient is \\(f'(x) = {(c\\times x^{0})}' = c\\times0x^{-1} = 0\\) for all \\(x\\). In other words, the constant function has no gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(f(x)=5x^7\\), what is \\(f'(x)\\)?\n\nBy the above, the gradient of \\(x^7\\) is \\(7x^{7-1} = 7x^6\\). Multiplying this by \\(5\\) gives that \\(f'(x)=35x^6\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10\\)?\n\nWe can either apply the above rule to each individual term of the polynomial (e.g. \\({(7x^2)}' = 7\\times2x^{2-1}=14x\\)) or computational software. For example, in Wolfram Alpha using derivative of f(x) = 4x^5 + 7x^2 - 8x + 10 returns \\(f'(x) = 20x^4 + 14x - 8\\). So the gradient of a polynomial of degree 5 is a polynomial function of power 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this can be further generalised to include cases where \\(n\\) is not an integer (a whole number, either positive or negative).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative of arbitrary powers\n\n\n\n\\((x^{a})' = ax^{a-1}\\) for any \\(x&gt;0\\) and any \\(a\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample A\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the gradient of \\(y=5x-\\sqrt{x}\\)?\n\nSince \\(\\sqrt{x} = x^{0.5}\\), it follows from our rules for powers that \\[\n  {(\\sqrt{x})}' = x^{0.5-1} = x^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{x^{0.5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}.\n\\] Then we have that \\(y'=5-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample B\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the derivative of \\(f(x) = 4\\sqrt{x}+ \\frac{7}{x} - \\sqrt[3]{x}\\)?\n\nWe note that this can be written as \\(f(x) = 4x^{\\frac{1}{2}} + 7x^{-1} - x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\). Then by applying to above rule to each term, \\[\n  f'(x) = 4\\times\\frac{1}{2} \\times x^{-\\frac{1}{2}} - 7x^{-2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\times x^{-\\frac{2}{3}}.\n\\] This can be simplified to \\(f'(x)= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{x}}-\\frac{7}{x^2} - \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\)."

No spaces\nNames cannot contain spaces.\n\nlucky_number &lt;- 5    ✔\nlucky number &lt;- 5    ✘\n\n(The spaces around &lt;- do not matter; only spaces inside the name are not allowed.)\n\n\n2. Names must start with a letter\nA name must begin with a letter, not a number.\n\nlucky_number &lt;- 5     ✔\n1lucky_number &lt;- 5    ✘\n\n\n\n3. R is case sensitive\nCapital letters matter.\n\nlucky_number\nLucky_Number\n\nThese refer to different objects.\n\n\n4. Some words cannot be used as names\nR has a set of reserved words that already have a special meaning. These include:\nif, else, for, in, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, NA, NaN, function\nYou do not need to memorise these. If you accidentally try to use one, R will warn you.\n\n\n\nObjects appear in the Environment pane\nAfter running a line such as:\n\nx &lt;- 5\n\nHere we have created an object called x with the value 5. You can now use x in later calculations. You should also see xappear in the Environment pane.\n\nTry using the stored x:\n\nx\n\n[1] 5\n\nx * 3\n\n[1] 15"

Putting It All Together\nHere is a full example combining several layers:\nggplot(freq_table, aes(area, n, fill = area)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Counts of respondents by sub-discipline\",\n    x = \"Sub-discipline\",\n    y = \"Number of respondents\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, 50) +\n  theme_light()\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(Degree, n, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of students in each degree subject\",\n    x = \"Degree subject\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, 60) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach new feature (labels, limits, themes) is added with another +, just like adding more words to a sentence.\n\nWhat this does\n\nangle = 45 rotates labels by 45 degrees\nhjust = 1 shifts them so they line up neatly under the tick marks\n\nIf you prefer vertical labels, use:\naxis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(Degree, n, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of students in each degree subject\",\n    x = \"Degree subject\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, 60) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer slightly slanted labels, use:\naxis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(Degree, n, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of students in each degree subject\",\n    x = \"Degree subject\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, 60) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd count (n) on top of bars\n\nstudents |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(Degree, n, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = n),\n    vjust = -0.3,        # move labels slightly above the bars\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of students in each degree subject\",\n    x = \"Degree subject\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, 60) +          # add space for labels\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was added?\ngeom_text(aes(label = n))\nThis tells ggplot to print the count (n) at the top of each bar.\nvjust = -0.3\nMoves the count slightly above the top of the bar so it’s visible.\n\n\nBar chart ordered from most common → least common\n\nstudents &lt;- students |&gt;\n  mutate(Degree = factor(Degree))\n\nWhat this does:\nThis ensures that Degree is stored as a factor (a proper categorical variable). We need this so we can later reorder the categories.\n\nplot_data &lt;- students |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;\n  mutate(Degree = fct_infreq(Degree))    # now this works\n\nWhat this does:\n\ncount(Degree) creates a frequency table (one row per degree + its count).\nfct_infreq(Degree) reorders the degree categories from most common → least common.\n\nThis only works because Degree is a factor.\n\n\n\nlevels(plot_data$Degree)\n\n [1] \"Anthropology\" \"Architecture\" \"Business\"     \"Design\"       \"Education\"   \n [6] \"English\"      \"History\"      \"Linguistics\"  \"Philosophy\"   \"Politics\"    \n[11] \"Psychology\"   \"Sociology\"   \n\n\nWhat this does:\nIt prints the order of the factor levels so we can check that they are now sorted by frequency.\n\nlibrary(forcats)  # loaded automatically with tidyverse, but safe to include\n\nWhat this does:\n\nLoads the forcats package (used for working with factors).\nIt’s already included inside tidyverse, but loading it explicitly is fine.\n\n\nplot_data &lt;- students |&gt;\n  mutate(Degree = fct_infreq(Degree)) |&gt;   # reorder by frequency (high → low)\n  count(Degree)                            # now count in that order\n\nWhat this does:\nA cleaner way to prepare the plot data:\n\nReorder Degree by frequency.\nCount how many students are in each degree using that order.\n\nThis gives us a properly ordered frequency table for the plot.\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Degree, y = n, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = n),\n    vjust = -0.3,\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of students in each degree subject (ordered by frequency)\",\n    x = \"Degree subject\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, max(plot_data$n) + 10) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this does, step by step:\n\nggplot(..., aes(...)) → sets up the plot: x-axis = Degree, y-axis = count.\ngeom_col() → draws bars with heights given by n.\ngeom_text(label = n) → adds the counts as text above each bar.\nlabs(...) → adds a title and axis labels.\nylim(0, max(plot_data$n) + 10) → adds space above the tallest bar so labels don’t overlap.\ntheme_light() → applies a clean theme.\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\nrotates the x-axis labels so they are easier to read.\nlegend.position = \"none\" → removes the legend (not needed because labels are already on the x-axis).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the ordered bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\nThis version of the chart orders degree subjects from most common to least common.\nLinguistics has the highest number of students (29), followed by Psychology (24) and Anthropology (22).\nSubjects such as Politics, Sociology, and Architecture are the least represented in this sample.\nOrdering categories by frequency makes it much easier to compare groups at a glance, especially when the list of categories is long.\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage Bar Plot\n\n# First create a summary table with counts and percentages\nplot_data &lt;- students |&gt;\n  count(Degree) |&gt;                                   # count how many students per degree\n  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 1))       # convert counts into percentages (rounded to 1 dp)\n\n# Now create the bar chart\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Degree, y = percent, fill = Degree)) +\n  geom_col() +                                       # draw bars with heights = percentages\n  geom_text(                                          # add text labels on top of bars\n    aes(label = paste0(percent, \"%\")),               # label = \"45%\" etc.\n    vjust = -0.3,                                     # move labels slightly above the bars\n    size = 4\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Percentage of students in each degree subject\",  # plot title\n    x = \"Degree subject\",                                     # x-axis label\n    y = \"Percentage\"                                          # y-axis label\n  ) +\n  ylim(0, max(plot_data$percent) + 10) +             # expand y-axis to make space for labels\n  theme_light() +                                    # use a clean, light theme\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # rotate x-axis labels for readability\n    legend.position = \"none\"                            # remove redundant legend\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry adding or removing layers to see what changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the percentage bar chart\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart shows how students are distributed across the different degree subjects. Linguistics is the most common subject, with 14.5% of the sample. Psychology follows with 12%, and Anthropology is close behind with 11%. Several subjects each account for around 7–10% of students (e.g., Business, Design, Education, History, Philosophy, Politics). Meanwhile, Architecture (3.5%) and Sociology (4.5%) are the least common subjects in this group.\nBecause the y-axis is in percentages, it is easy to compare subjects even though the raw numbers might differ. The percentage labels on each bar make the chart especially readable, allowing us to see immediately which subjects are more or less popular in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeacher note: Why percentages are often better than counts?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen teaching categorical data, showing percentages instead of raw counts is usually clearer and more informative. Here’s why:\n\n✔ Normalises the data\nPercentages allow you to compare groups fairly, even when total sample sizes differ.\nA bar that represents “20 students” means something very different in a sample of 40 vs a sample of 400 — but 50% always means the same thing.\n\n\n✔ Helps us to interpret results quickly\nMany people understand percentages more intuitively than raw counts.\nSeeing “12%” immediately conveys the relative size of a group.\n\n\n✔ Makes charts easier to compare\nTwo charts from different datasets become directly comparable when both are expressed in percentages.\n\n\n✔ Reduces misinterpretation\nSometimes we might assume the largest count is the “most important” group.\nUsing percentages shifts the focus to proportions, which is what most analyses care about.\n\n\n✔ Great preparation for inferential statistics\nLater techniques (chi-square tests, proportions tests, confidence intervals) rely on proportions, so using percentages early builds good habits."

What is the meaning of the \\(y\\)-intercept?\nPlot \\(y = P(x)\\) with a logarithmic \\(y\\)-axis. What’s the gradient now?\n\n\n\n2.2 Population Growth\nGiven an initial population size \\(P_0\\), a growth rate \\(r\\) per day, and a maximum feasible population size \\(K\\), the population on day \\(t\\) is modelled logistically as\n\\[\n  P(t) = \\frac{P_0 \\cdot K}{P_0 + (K - P_0)e^{-rt}}.\n\\]\n\nPlot this model for \\(P_0 = 10\\), \\(K = 500\\), and \\(r = 0.5\\).\nWhat is the range of this model for a domain \\(t\\geq0\\)?\nWhat happens if we extend the domain to \\(t &lt; 0\\)?\n\n\n\n2.3 Sound\nYou may have heard of decibel as a measure of how ‘loud’ something is. You may even have seen a chart like the one below that compare different sounds.\n\n\n\nGenerator Decibel Comparison Chart, Tom Holland (2022), CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\n\nWhat you might not known though is that decibels are a logarithmic scale, defined by the equation \\[\n  d = 10\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{0}}\\right).\n\\] Here \\(p\\) is the intensity or power of the sound (measured in Watts), \\(p_0\\) is intensity of the faintest audible sound, and \\(d\\) is volume in decibels.\nUsing this equation with \\(p_0 = 1\\) Watt, create a version of the graphic above that uses power, rather than decibels, to measure the sound."

For example:\n\nWhich categories are most common?\n\nAre some categories rare?\n\nIs the distribution fairly balanced or dominated by one or two groups?\n\nFor each categorical variable in your report, include either the bar plot or the frequency table (not both) to avoid duplicating information.\n\nYou do not need to include R output in the report; you only need the written description. Keep this paragraph; you will re-use it in your report."

No spaces\nNames cannot contain spaces.\n\nlucky_number &lt;- 5    ✔\nlucky number &lt;- 5    ✘\n\n(The spaces around &lt;- do not matter; only spaces inside the name are not allowed.)\n\n\n2. Names must start with a letter\nA name must begin with a letter, not a number.\n\nlucky_number &lt;- 5     ✔\n1lucky_number &lt;- 5    ✘\n\n\n\n3. R is case sensitive\nCapital letters matter.\n\nlucky_number\nLucky_Number\n\nThese refer to different objects.\n\n\n4. Some words cannot be used as names\nR has a set of reserved words that already have a special meaning. These include:\nif, else, for, in, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, NA, NaN, function\nYou do not need to memorise these. If you accidentally try to use one, R will warn you.\n\n\n\nObjects appear in the Environment pane\nAfter running a line such as:\n\nx &lt;- 5\n\nHere we have created an object called x with the value 5. You can now use x in later calculations. You should also see xappear in the Environment pane.\n\nTry using the stored x:\n\nx\n\n[1] 5\n\nx * 3\n\n[1] 15"

In this teaching file there are relatively few missing values across variables.\n\n\n\nA dataset containing information on 400 higher-education institutions in the United States was analysed. The dataset includes variables describing each institution’s geographical location (state, region, and local setting), sector type (public, private, or for-profit), and whether it represents a main or branch campus. Several numeric variables provide information on undergraduate enrolment, proportions of part-time students, and costs such as in-state and out-of-state tuition. The dataset also reports the demographic composition of each institution’s student body, including the percentage of students identifying as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Other.\nInitial inspection shows substantial variation in enrolment and tuition levels, and a small amount of missing data (for example, 1 missing value in Locale, 24 missing values in Enrollment, PartTime, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other, and 36 missing in TuitionIn and TuitionOut). Overall, the dataset offers a clear structure suitable for exploring relationships between institutional characteristics, costs, and student demographics."

In this teaching file there are relatively few missing values across variables.\n\n\n\nA dataset containing information on 400 higher-education institutions in the United States was analysed. The dataset includes variables describing each institution’s geographical location (state, region, and local setting), sector type (public, private, or for-profit), and whether it represents a main or branch campus. Several numeric variables provide information on undergraduate enrolment, proportions of part-time students, and costs such as in-state and out-of-state tuition. The dataset also reports the demographic composition of each institution’s student body, including the percentage of students identifying as White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Other.\nInitial inspection shows substantial variation in enrolment and tuition levels, and a small amount of missing data (for example, 1 missing value in Locale, 24 missing values in Enrollment, PartTime, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other, and 36 missing in TuitionIn and TuitionOut). Overall, the dataset offers a clear structure suitable for exploring relationships between institutional characteristics, costs, and student demographics."
